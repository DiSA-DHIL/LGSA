               <p>The Dakota prairie was an infinity of darkness through which the
                  buckboard rolled over the rutted trail with an eternal motion. To the small
                  girl-child crouched on the floor boards beside her father’s legs, the darkness and
                  the rolling motion seemed of infinite duration. It had started in a confusion of
                  strange activities that shattered her familiar world, back in a blue dusk that lay
                  in the back of her mind, weighted with perplexing mysteries. It had gone on and on
                  and on in ever deepening mystery and darkening shadows to which there seemed no
                  end. Except for the rumps of the horses, with their whisking tails that brushed
                  the dashboard with a reedy sound, there was nothing to see and nothing to hear but
                  the steady clop-clop of their pounding feet and the creaking noise of the wheels.
                  Everything else was a wilderness dark, wrapped in a silence so heavy she was
                  afraid to sleep.</p>
               <p>It was all very queer. That morning, which now seemed such ages
                  ago, she had wakened in a madhouse. The bed opposite her little cot where her
                  parents slept was in pieces, the feather ticks and pillows lying in bundles on the
                  floor. The kitchen was full of boxes. The big stove where she usually struggled
                  into her little clothes to the comforting crackle of fire and the humming of the
                  copper kettle, was cold and desolate. The baby, tied in the old black rocker,
                  squirmed and whimpered unheeded, for mamma had eyes for nothing but the dishes she
                  was hastily packing in the wash tub. And papa, equally preoccupied, was unscrewing
                  the legs of the table. Even her brother, who might have been expected to find a
                  teasing word of greeting, was out in the lean-to busily stuffing sheep’s wool into
                  a canvas sack. No one had paid her the slightest attention until, the dishes
                  packed, her mother called out sharply:</p>
               <p>‘Dress yourself, child! Don’t stand there like a stick!’</p>
               <p>When mamma spoke in that tone of voice, you did as you were told
                  and asked no questions. She had dressed, and a little later had eaten a cold egg,
                  which she hated, and had obediently drunk a cup of milk, which was almost as bad.
                  Eggs and milk and the long prayers she was obliged to say each night were a
                  trinity of unavoidable trials. The eggs always made a sour taste in her mouth, and
                  the prayers frightened her with their vague suggestions of yawning eternities. The
                  milk had at least one element of comfort. If mamma was not looking, the cat could
                  always be prevailed upon to finish the cup.</p>
               <p>Oh, but that was the worst of all! The dear grey cat was gone,
                  along with everything else stable and familiar. If only Tabby were here, purring
                  on her breast, the darkness and the endless silence would not matter. Always, when
                  something had gone sadly awry in her small world, it was to Tabby she carried her
                  woe, and, in its inimitable way, the soft little creature had eased away the
                  misery and filled her heart with comfort.</p>
               <p>Blinking back tears, the child edged a little closer to her
                  father’s legs. By some unerring instinct of intuition, she knew that her mother,
                  sitting stiffly erect with the sleeping baby in her lap, was miles removed in
                  consciousness, shut away from them all in a bitter world of her own. But her
                  father, in whom a poetic temperament made the transition from gloom to gaiety an
                  easy process, might perchance by a little nudge be made aware of her loneliness.
                  If only papa would say something, in his warm, pleasant voice, everything might
                  right itself, and even this sudden endless journey through the prairie might take
                  on reasonable meaning. Papa could always make sense out of nonsense—even mamma
                  admitted that.</p>
               <p>But it was her mother’s voice, thin and strained, that cut the
                  silence like a silver whip.</p>
               <p>‘Can’t we go faster, Lars? It will soon be black as pitch.’</p>
               <p>‘We’re getting there,’ her father replied amiably, flicking the
                  reins. ‘A slow gait is a sure one, my dear.’</p>
               <p>‘I should not think you’d want to keep the Ericsons waiting up half
                  the night for us,’ her mother retorted, and caught her breath sharply. For
                  suddenly the night was full of weird sounds, high, shrill, intolerable yapping
                  sounds that raced along the dark horizon as though the air itself had found a
                  thousand tongues with which to lash the silence. The horses jumped in their
                  traces, tossed up their drooping heads, and, snorting with fear, started off at a
                  gallop. The wild lurch pitched the child against the dashboard, but her father’s
                  hand shot out of the dark and drew her back to his knees. Shivering, she clung to
                  those knees, too frightened for tears. Besides, now she understood why mamma had
                  sat so straight and still. These awful noises were the terrors that haunted her
                  nights and days. They were the wolves!</p>
               <p>She had heard them before, though never so monstrously magnified,
                  so terrifyingly close, and she remembered her mother’s blanching face and the
                  bitter words she had flung at papa.</p>
               <p>‘Now this I will not endure,’ she had said, with hard, quiet
                  finality. Other things, too, she had said, which the child could not understand,
                  but now she realized that this race through the night was an effort to get away
                  from the things her mother would not endure. And somehow she knew it was not just
                  the wolves her mother heard in this awful clamour, but the savage tongues of this
                  dark land, itself the voice of the wilderness for which her mother had no heart
                  and against which she fought with cold determined resolution.</p>
               <p>‘There you are!’ her mother cried bitterly. ‘We shall be eaten
                  alive! A fine finish to a brave venture.’</p>
               <p>Her father laughed, not very brightly. ‘That would be history,’ he
                  said. ‘A pack of coyotes attacking a team at full gallop. Use your sense, my
                  dear—you are so proud of it. I have told you often enough there are no wolves left
                  in this part of the country.’</p>
               <p>‘You told me the lambs were safe last week. You know what
                  happened.’</p>
               <p>‘It’s a long time since you and I were lambs, my dear. There is a
                  comforting thought,’ he rejoined, with a chuckle, that eased the strain in the
                  little girl’s body. But her mother refused to be comforted.</p>
               <p>‘If you had as much wisdom as wit, we should not be here,’ she
                  said.</p>
               <p>To which her father replied, ‘Well, we won’t be here long, Borga.
                  And wit has a way of dying in the sweat shops of the city.’</p>
               <p>A cry from the back of the blackboard, where her brother sat
                  perched on top of bundles and boxes, put an end to the argument. ‘Look! Look!
                  There’s a light!’ he shouted. ‘We’re all right now, mamma. That’s the house!’</p>
               <p>So it was. Far ahead, in the midst of an ocean of darkness, two
                  small jets of light stood out like candle flames braving the night. Why it should
                  be so, I cannot say, but those wavering jets of yellow light marked a division of
                  time for the little girl at her father’s feet. From that moment her little
                  thoughts and starry impressions were distinctly individual, and she herself no
                  longer just the little girl who existed as a small, obedient extension of her
                  mother. Struggling to her numbed feet and leaning against her father’s knee, she
                  stared in silent fascination at the nearing points of lights, and suddenly, for no
                  apparent reason, a delightfully wicked thought popped into her head.</p>
               <p>‘Even if it’s a troll’s house, I won’t eat an
                     egg!’ she resolved.</p>
               <p>In which fine frenzy a predestined rebel was born—the rebel who is
                  myself.</p>
               <p>The Ericsons, I was to learn much later, were considered a queer
                  pair. In those good old Victorian days, the slightest departure from the accepted
                  conventions was sufficient to earn one a suspect reputation. To question the
                  Trinity, fail to hang your clothes out on Monday morning, or give house-room to a
                  book of Thomas Ingersoll, any of these was enough to arouse the criticism of the
                  righteous. So far as I ever knew, the Ericsons were innocent of such monstrous
                  errors, but they kept a ‘heathen beast’ (of which more later) and they had no
                  children. That, in itself, was a suspicious circumstance in an age of step-ladder
                  families, and argued either the wrath of God or a wilful obstruction of His
                  blessed favour.</p>
               <p>Beyond that, it seems the queer pair behaved normally. They had
                  come to Dakota with that fugitive band of Icelanders who, despite the
                  remonstrances of the Canadian Government, had quit the fly-ridden marshlands of
                  Manitoba, to which they were consigned, and, the men on foot, their women in
                  ox-carts, trekked to the fertile plains across the border. They were industrious;
                  the furrows lengthened year by year, and neither the grasshopper plague, the
                  furious winds, nor the thieving wolves, had dampened their faith in the country.
                  Indeed, it was this glowing faith, communicated over a mild glass of toddy, which
                  had persuaded my impressionable father that the nearest approach to
                  heaven-upon-earth was a sheep ranch in Dakota. To obtain this leasehold on bliss,
                  a neat little cottage with a white picket fence around its patch of green garden
                  was sacrificed, much against my mother’s will and better judgement. As for the
                  ranch, it consisted of a log house for which my mother had an unreasoning hatred
                  as the lowest habitation possible to men; I don’t know how many acres of unbroken
                  scrub prairie; a dozen sheep; a cow.</p>
               <p>But now the venture was over. Once again, penniless, and with
                  nothing but the bedding, our clothes, and a few pieces of furniture, we were on
                  the move, our immediate destination the sod-roofed cabin of the hospitable though
                  queer Ericsons.</p>
               <p>That visit stamps the beginning of memory—the first of a chain of
                  unrelated events, insignificant in themselves, and yet each one having its
                  ineradicable, subtle effect upon my future reaction to life. That I should
                  remember so much of that visit after almost forty-four years is not particularly
                  remarkable. Extremes of emotion leave indelible marks. And certainly that was a
                  night of tragi-comic extremes.</p>
               <p>The Ericsons, two bent gnomes peering anxiously into the darkness,
                  were waiting in the open doorway. They had almost despaired of our coming that
                  night, and were about to go to bed, when they heard the horses. They were pleased
                  as children to be cheated of their rest, and bustled us into the house with
                  embarrassing effusion. They were short and dark and leathery, and, to my childish
                  eyes, differed in nothing, except that Mr. Anderson had a tuft of hair on his chin
                  and was dressed in baggy brown homespun trousers, whereas Mrs. Anderson’s tuft was
                  under her nose, and she wore a wide skirt, of the same material.</p>
               <p>Their voices were high-pitched and thin—as though they had worn
                  them threadbare calling to each other across the windswept fields. And when either
                  one made a statement, it was referred back to the other, prefixed by a
                  question:</p>
               <p>‘Ha? Kvad heldur pú, Runa? Eh? What do you think, Runa?’</p>
               <p>‘Ha? Pú sejir satt, Noni! Eh? You are right, Noni!’</p>
               <p>The house was very hot and smelled of boiled mutton, for we had
                  been expected for hours, and the stewpot still simmered at the back of the stove.
                  There was a wall lamp with a tin shield behind it that dazzled my eyes and made me
                  think of the fierce-looking angel in the story-book who stood at the gates of Eden
                  brandishing a crooked sword.</p>
               <p>A table was spread with plates of doughnuts, liver sausage, pickled
                  sheep’s head, bread and butter, and the omnipresent, ever-heated eggs. A bureau
                  with a marble top and a cracked mirror occupied a place of honour between the two
                  small windows, and flaunted for all to see a fat, poison-green plush album with
                  real brass clasps!</p>
               <p>There my discoveries ended. Something agile and swift leaped from
                  under the table where the cloth had kept it hidden, and, with the ease of a bird,
                  settled on the back of the kitchen chair not a dozen steps from me.</p>
               <p>My heart went out to the marvellous creature at once. He had eyes,
                  black and bright as new shoe buttons, that stared at me out of a tiny yellow face
                  no bigger than an apple, yet absurdly human. He capered about on the back of the
                  chair, making the funniest chattering noises that made me think of hail on a
                  window-pane, and a little of mamma when she was very cross.</p>
               <p>I was rooted to the spot with mounting admiration. When Mrs.
                  Ericson, having settled my mother and the baby in comfort before the fire, came to
                  help me, I suffered myself to be peeled out of my little tight coat without
                  hearing a word she said, nor remembering to hold my hand out politely. Even
                  mamma’s voice, gentle now, and full of concern, calling me to the fire, had no
                  effect. I could not leave off watching the intriguing yellow creature.</p>
               <p>Still in a daze, I found myself whisked to a milking, stool, given
                  a piece of sugar, and told to sit still like a good child and wait for my supper.
                  The sugar slipped into the little pocket of my dress, for, though I detested
                  everything sweet, all through childhood I had a squirrel’s instinct to hide such
                  stuff away. But neither sugar nor supper occupied my puzzled thoughts. With what
                  wit I had, I was trying to penetrate the mystery before me. How could anything so
                  much like a baby be covered with fur? And, if it wasn’t a queer sort of baby, what
                  was it scolding about? What sort of creature pulled faces like a boy, wagged its
                  head like an old woman, and scratched its yellow stomach with tiny, pink-palmed
                  paws?</p>
               <p>He was not a cat, nor was he a dog. And, of course, no ordinary
                  baby was smart enough to perch on the back of a chair, to say nothing of bobbing
                  about, flailing its arms. I could not think what he was, but when he suddenly
                  hooked a long tail round a rung, and popped to the floor, and, quick as a cat’s
                  wink, popped up again, an enchanting solution broke on my mind. Completely
                  forgetting that nice little girls were seen and not heard, I shrieked out
                  ecstatically:</p>
               <p>‘Papa! Papa! It’s a king’s son in a cat’s skin! And I’m going to
                  love him for ever and ever!’</p>
               <p>Alas for budding genius! Gales of heartless laughter greeted my
                  heroic invention. It was a bitter blow. Big people were little better than trolls,
                  I thought. Indeed, they were very like them. In the stories that mamma read to me,
                  Tröll-karls and Tröll-skessur were always roaring with laughter at the wrong
                  moment. Papa, at least, might have remembered that it was he himself had told me
                  the sad tale of the golden-haired princeling who was changed into a bear, and had
                  to go roaring through the black pine forest for ever and ever—which, of course,
                  meant until the woodcutter’s little daughter loved him in spite of the roaring and
                  stole away his hide.</p>
               <p>I subsided into humiliating silence, confused, but not convinced.
                  The mystery still remained. The little yellow beast was in a fury because no one
                  understood him, no matter how hard he talked. He jittered and stared accusingly,
                  and sometimes, covered his tiny face in his funny wee paws, and shook pitiably. He
                  could not be happy inside himself!</p>
               <p>All through supper the alarming fancy grew on me that here was no
                  mortal household; that Mrs. Ericson, with her blue moustache and nimble chatter,
                  was a witch, and no woman at all. It really didn’t take much reasoning. You found
                  her house, as you found all witches’ houses, after a terrifying gallop through the
                  dark. On the doorstep she waited for you, with a crooked little man at her side,
                  and a bright, blinding light at her back. It was so hot in her house you might
                  fall asleep unawares, and be turned into goodness knows what sort of creature.
                  And, most convincing of all, there was a huge black pot brewing and stewing on her
                  huge black range!</p>
               <p>More and more confused, more and more weary, it was perhaps not
                  extraordinary that my behaviour should vex my mother. I not only refused to eat an
                  egg when it was sprinkled with sugar, but I rudely pushed away the stew. No. No. I
                  would not have it, I glowered. No. No. No. I could not and dared not explain that
                  spells were brewed in black pots. I could only shove the dish away with
                  disgraceful impoliteness. My father saved the situation by taking me on his knee
                  and letting me dunk a doughnut in his coffee. The doughnut appeased the
                  disagreeable gnawing under my breast bone, and the warm curve of my father’s arm
                  comforted the crink in my back. If only I might have slept there, the scandalous
                  business to follow might have been averted.</p>
               <p>But I was snatched from this pleasant shelter. It was time to go to
                  bed. To-morrow we were driving to Crystal, where a train would take us on to
                  Winnipeg. None of which meant anything to me, except that I guessed it was a place
                  mamma preferred to the sheep ranch, and papa, on the other hand, somehow dreaded.
                  For, vaguely, I had become conscious of the conflict of ideas between my parents—a
                  conflict which was never to end, and precluded any solid, satisfying home life, in
                  the conventional sense.</p>
               <p>I have no recollection of the bedroom as a bedroom into which my
                  mother led me. But for years I relived in nightmares the terror of that room.
                  There was a big bed in it piled with the usual feather tick and patchwork quilts,
                  but, when my mother threw back the covers, I caught sight of something under the
                  hay mattress that turned my skin to ice. It was a red, hairy hide! In fact, a
                  cowhide, spread over the home-made rope spring—to me, a hammur,
                  the bewitched hide, waiting to swallow my little self. And, to further confuse my
                  infant reasoning, I now remembered with horror an episode which had taken place a
                  few days ago.</p>
               <p>I had formed the odious habit of eating paper. No amount of
                  scolding had cured me of the crime. But one morning, on following my mother into
                  the lean-to, I saw stretched upon the wall the gory hide of the little calf which
                  only the day before had been gambolling in the back-yard.</p>
               <p>‘Mamma!’ I had shrieked, pointing to the hide, ‘that’s the little
                  calf, rolled out——!’</p>
               <p>‘Oh, I know,’ replied mamma, seriously, shaking her head. ‘You see,
                  the poor thing ate paper.’</p>
               <p>Well, I had not eaten paper since, but now it seemed my sins were
                  finding me out. The cowhide was a menace. The calf who ate paper, the little
                  animal that resembled a baby but wasn’t a baby, the old woman with a moustache,
                  and the bubbling black kettle, all combined to make a nightmare of fear in my
                  tired child’s mind. When my poor distraught mother reached out to take me on her
                  knee and undress me, I screamed and hit out like a little fiend. She was
                  unaccustomed to such behaviour in her children. I was soundly smacked and severely
                  shaken, all to no effect. Hysteria gave me the strength and viciousness of a wild
                  cat. I fought and scratched and wriggled and squirmed, quite as determined to stay
                  out of that bed as my mother was determined to put me into it.</p>
               <p>In the end, after repeatedly flinging me into the feather tick,
                  only to see me roll to the floor, it was she who gave up the battle. Worn out and
                  unhappy, completely mystified by this sudden transformation of a peaceable, pudgy
                  infant into a raging limb of Satan, she left me to sob out my meanness on the
                  floor. All night I lay there, abandoned to wickedness, and only fell asleep when
                  the grey morning light, stealing in through a small, barred window, fell on my
                  cold little face like gentle, forgiving fingers.</p>

            <div>
               <head>I Discover My Birthplace</head>
               <p>I have no further recollection of that journey to Winnipeg, nor any
                  clear memory of our arrival in that muddy village. I do remember, however, that we
                  went to live in a row of houses, all built alike, all having bay windows; floors
                  where the frost gathered around the doors and baseboards; and facing upon a street
                  where two planks represented the last word in civic improvement.</p>
               <p>In wet weather, the road, like an angry sea-serpent looping along,
                  dripped a red, gummy spume, through which horses and men slithered and slipped,
                  and often enough, to my vast amusement, sank half-way to their knees. Rubbers were
                  sucked off with a hungry, smacking sound, and the feet of the horses
                  glug-glug-glugged endlessly. In winter patches of ice formed in the low spots, and
                  the little ridges of dirty snow made the sleighs jolt and screech as they flew by
                  to the sound of singing bells.</p>
               <p>Winter, I discovered, had compensations. It was bad to have your
                  feet always cold, and disagreeable to run into the kitchen only to find every
                  chair spread with frozen clothes off the line, but it was pleasant to make a clear
                  spot on the snowy window-pane and watch the hurrying world go by. No one ever got
                  stuck in the winter time. Horses were never beaten to make them strain and
                  struggle in a sickening manner. No angry shouts and rumble of ugly words rent the
                  air. In the winter, all sorts of queer contraptions and funny people came to see
                  papa. There was a sleigh, with a top like a house, where a stove-pipe gave off
                  feathers of smoke, and out of which men and women tumbled like the animals out of
                  the Ark. They came from Icelandic River, and sometimes they brought a gift of
                  fish, deer meat, or mutton, and now and then a bag of wool. Most of the men had
                  whiskers and smoked short pipes, which made me think they were all grandfathers.
                  For papa neither smoked nor wore a beard, but only now and then dipped snuff from
                  a pretty silver box; and his moustache was short and carefully trimmed. His hair,
                  too, was sleek and black as the fur on my new tomcat, whereas these visiting
                  grandfathers, for the most part, were thatched with sandy-coloured straw.</p>
               <p>The women either brought babies, or, when they left after a stay in
                  Winnipeg, took babies back with them. It was a little tiresome, to be sure, and
                  yet there was a certain thrill in seeing the door fly open, and bundles of people
                  rolling in, with whiffs of frosty air circling them in clouds. There was always a
                  lot of laughter, mysterious headshakes, and once the visit got under way, pots and
                  pots of coffee, with plates of mamma’s famous pancakes. Sometimes, too, there was
                  singing, and a queer kind of chanting, which papa called Kveda,
                  and told me I should listen, for the verses were full of ancient wisdom. It was a
                  dignified sort of noise, so I usually listened willingly enough, especially if
                  papa let me sip from his saucer when mamma was not looking.</p>
               <p>There came a time, however, when papa failed to come home. He had
                  been taken sick, and carried to the hospital. It was a little colder in the house
                  thereafter and the pancakes had a flat taste, and mamma drank her coffee
                  black.</p>
               <p>Not long after that, mother dressed me in my little coat, and said
                  we must make a visit to Great-Uncle Jonathan. She had work to do, she said, and I
                  must be a good child and stay with uncle until she fetched me. It was fun
                  following the crack in the plank sidewalk, and speculating upon where we were
                  going. When we got there I saw before us a small white house, with two trees in
                  front of the low veranda. There was a little hall, where mother took off my coat
                  and hung it on a nail. It was queer, I thought, that no one met us. But a moment
                  later, when we stepped into the room giving off the hall, I understood, and was
                  struck dumb.</p>
               <p>In the middle of the room was a strange sort of chair, with big
                  yellow wheels and a high yellow back. In the chair sat a man dressed in a purple
                  gown, his legs covered with a plaid shawl. His eyes, deep, brown, and luminous,
                  turned on us out of a serious face that looked parchment pale in contrast with the
                  long, flowing, curly brown beard that rippled down his bosom.</p>
               <p>It was an awesome moment! Made doubly so when I heard my mother
                  say, quite calmly: ‘Kondu saell godi min.’</p>
               <p>I clutched her skirt. Surely even a mother ought not to say to the
                  Lord, careless-like, ‘How do you do, my dear!’ But no thunderclap followed. Just a
                  very human rumble, replying, ‘So-so-so-so—what have you got there behind your
                  skirts?’</p>
               <p>I decided to risk a peep. The bearded monarch was smiling—actually
                  smiling. Oh, thought I, with boundless relief. It was not the Lord God Almighty
                  after all. God was not the smiling sort. It must be Moses. . . .</p>
               <p>Even that was not quite accurate, I learned to my astonishment. The
                  venerable gentleman was very like a patriarch, and, as I was many years later to
                  see, actually resembled Michelangelo’s Moses, but he was just my Great-Uncle
                  Jonathan, an old, old sea captain, many years home from the sea.</p>
               <p>That was the beginning of the happiest months of my entire
                  childhood. Great-uncle was confined to an invalid’s chair, having suffered a
                  stroke which left his legs paralysed. It was a secret between us that I took care
                  of uncle, and not uncle of me. He was a beautiful old man of impressive dignity,
                  and full of quiet humour. His little, plainly furnished room, which we very
                  shortly turned into a lively universe, round which we shipped from port to port,
                  lives unspoiled in my memory.</p>
               <p>There were shelves with books, and shells and stones, and dried
                  sea-urchins. Sometimes uncle secreted raisins on these shelves, for which we
                  cruised under full sail. The raisins I disliked, as all sweets, but I ate them in
                  the same reckless spirit in which Mother Eve ate of the forbidden fruit. Raisins
                  came from Spain, great-uncle said, and in Spain the señoritas were a joy to
                  behold.</p>
               <p>‘Ah, there were pretty girls for you!’ said my uncle, stroking his
                  beard, and twinkling at me with his warm brown eyes. ‘Little devils, too. They
                  danced the heart from your breast, wore it for a posy a day or two, and tossed it
                  away with a laugh.’</p>
               <p>In Barcelona there was a girl he still remembered. A slip of a
                  black-eyed thing with a rose in her midnight hair, and laughter on her scarlet
                  lips. Ah, she made a merry fool of more than one poor sailor, said my uncle,
                  sighing. But it was all so long ago, he remembered nothing very clearly, except
                  the sound of her twinkling feet—he sometimes heard them now, on the window-pane,
                  when the hard, bright prairie rain was falling.</p>
               <p>I, too, heard her after that. When the dusk came down on a wet and
                  windy day I loved to sit at my uncle’s feet, listening for the tiny castanets, and
                  the swish of invisible, silken garments. For her sake I would have eaten a pound
                  of raisins and never turned a hair!</p>
               <p>There were other reminiscences, less appealing, but full of
                  thrilling marvels. Great-uncle had been a deep-sea sailor, and visited many
                  ‘foreign parts’. For instance, he had been to Scotland, where the gentlemen wore
                  petticoats; to England, too, in the days when the good queen, now so pious and
                  severe, was a little young thing with lively grace in her eye.</p>
               <p>Grace of heart, too, she had, said my uncle, ‘God save her
                  Majesty!’ Why, when the queen learned that little boys no bigger than myself were
                  poked up the chimneys of rich people’s houses—and, possibly, the palace—to clean
                  away the soot, she put her foot down instantly. It had to stop, she said—or the
                  chimneys widened to admit bigger boys.</p>
               <p>What was more, the little queen put an end to gibbets, said my
                  uncle. Gibbets were something bad people dangled from, and blew about in the wind
                  like socks on a line. It spoiled the landscape, and hurt the feelings of any nice
                  young lady who came upon such a sight at the cross-roads. So all the gibbets were
                  instantly chopped down. There were other things which the young queen did not
                  like: women crawling about in mines, when they ought to be home raising babies for
                  the nation; riots in Ireland, where the people were always short of potatoes, and
                  just as short of temper, so uncle said. And much more of which I have no
                  recollection, because it was entirely outside my infant ken.</p>
               <p>When he spoke of the sea, and the flying ships, with the winds of
                  the world at their backs, I did not have to understand. I could feel the wet spray
                  in my face, and see the dolphin dancing in the sun. I shivered when the storms
                  blew up, and knew beyond doubt what trials lay ahead for crew and cargo when a red
                  ring lay around the moon. It did not frighten me when ‘another poor devil went
                  overboard’, nor seem at all strange that his poor, grey ghost should be seen
                  aimlessly flitting up and down the rigging. Ghosts held no more terror for me than
                  the make-believe spirit inside myself, the irrepressible creature that played in
                  the puddles by the corner pump, thought nothing at all of climbing the roof to
                  touch the stars, and even said, in its heart, a hundred times: I won’t be a girl
                  to sew a fine seam and rock a little cradle!</p>
               <p>Sometimes we kept off the sea, and pillaged about on the land.
                  ‘Now, let me think,’ great-uncle would begin, as soon as the door closed behind
                  mamma, ‘Where should we go faring to-day, little one?’</p>
               <p>‘Not on the seas, uncle dear, the good ship needs repairing after
                  the gale yesterday.’</p>
               <p>‘True, true, so she does,’ he replies. ‘Well then, we shut our eyes
                  and fly to Iceland, where the Hidden People found a lasting refuge when the Lord
                  God cast them off.’</p>
               <p>How was that, I wanted to know, suspecting that the Lord God had
                  started another flood, or burned another Tyre for the fun of it.</p>
               <p>‘It was like this,’ my uncle began. ‘Mother Eve had spent a busy
                  day setting her new house to rights. A very tiresome business for a body straight
                  from Eden, where work was quite unknown. It was coming on evening, with a nice
                  wind blowing from the coco-nut groves. Adam was dawdling down by the well, most
                  likely admiring his beard. There was no help to be had from him, and the children
                  were all unwashed and dirty. All but Cain and Abel, that is. They, to be sure, had
                  their faces scrubbed, and sat on a bright new stool, swinging their legs. At that
                  moment, poor Eve looks towards the palms, and sees where the Lord is walking,
                  taking the air, communing with himself. What’s to be done, thinks Eve, terrified
                  to be found as bad a mother as she was once found a mischievous maid. The Lord God
                  was coming to call. Oh, she knew that in her bones. And here were all the little
                  wretches, except Cain and Abel, covered with bramble scratches, berry stains, and
                  plain dirt to boot.</p>
               <p>‘ “Quick, my little ones!” Mother Eve spoke sharply and waved her
                  broom. “Run and hide, and for goodness’ sake keep quiet!”</p>
               <p>‘So the Lord God finds a tidy house, a tidy woman, and, very
                  politely, Cain and Abel leap down to let Him have the stool.</p>
               <p>‘ “How goes the struggle, Mother Eve?” the Lord asks, very
                  kindly.</p>
               <p>‘ “Not too badly,” says Eve, “not badly at all, except that Adam
                  leans too long on his hoe, to my thinking.”</p>
               <p>‘ “Hmm,” says the Lord, a bit of a twinkle in his eye. “And how are
                  the children?”</p>
               <p>‘ “They could be worse,” says Eve, making a sign to Cain to stop
                  digging up the dust with his toe. “They do very well on the earth, if I may say
                  so.”</p>
               <p>‘ “Hmm,” says the Lord, surprised-like, but still very gentle. “And
                  are these all the children, Mother Eve?”</p>
               <p>‘Eve hung her head. How could she bring those little wretches into
                  the presence of the Lord God, who was dressed in purple and gold with the power of
                  life and death in His hands?</p>
               <p>‘ “Lord, these are all,” she said.</p>
               <p>‘ “Yea, only these,” poor Eve forswore.</p>
               <p>‘Then the Lord rose, and His robes made a sweeping sound, as of
                  many winds, and His voice was terrible as thunder.</p>
               <p>‘ “Hear me, then, Eve. What thou hast hidden, let be for ever
                  hidden!”</p>
               <p>‘That my little lamb, is how the Hidden People came to be,’ uncle
                  finished. ‘And I’m not sure they got the worst of the bargain.’</p>
               <p>Nor was I, when he had told me a tale or two. They had no souls of
                  course—neither heaven nor hell was open to them. But it was very jolly to flit
                  about, lightly as shadows, to live in little knolls, and build homesteads and
                  churches in the heart of a mountain. It was worth doing without a soul, when you
                  could disappear through walls, walk on water as easily as on dry land, and enter a
                  rock as readily as a mortal entered a doorway! What was more, the Hidden People
                  had magic powers against which mere mortals were helpless. If they chose to build
                  a house in a nice green knoll in the bishop’s field, his lordship knew better than
                  to have the grass cut. Once, a foolish fellow attempted such a trick, and all his
                  hay flew away in a wind that swooped out of a calm sky, like a hawk a-hunting. Oh,
                  it wasn’t safe at all to disturb the peace of fairy dwellings! Indeed, if you were
                  wise, you kept the larder unlocked, just in case it was a hard year below, and the
                  hidden tenants needed a bit of meal or slice of smoked mutton. When they were
                  treated with kindness, the Hidden People watched your cattle, and saw to it that
                  no evil befell them.</p>
               <p>They were kindly baggages, on the whole, said my uncle—a little too
                  given to vain attire, perhaps, and to the light fantastic, but for that he could
                  not seriously blame them. A wench in homespun, with lead in her feet, was a sad
                  sight anywhere. No, if they had any real fault, it was the passion for stealing
                  human babies. Poor things, they could not forswear the hope of somehow obtaining
                  an immortal soul.</p>
               <p>These tales were a perpetual joy. They absorbed me so completely
                  that sometimes I wondered if I were not a changeling myself. It might very well
                  be, for my thoughts were very foolish, I knew, and, moreover, I had overheard
                  mamma telling a visitor I had been the smallest baby. In fact, a funny little
                  thing, only four pounds, and with black hair to my shoulders! That was odd, when
                  you came to think of it. The last two babies—whom God had given and taken away, as
                  seemed to be His habit—were much bigger than that, and with very little hair on
                  their little round heads.</p>
               <p>But, if uncle’s stories absorbed me, the day arrived when another
                  obsession obscured every common fact. That was when I mounted an empty apple box,
                  and started telling tales myself. Time flew, thereafter, and if mamma was late in
                  coming for me, I scarcely noticed. Indeed, I sometimes forgot I was her little
                  girl at all, and bound to go home to a chilly house and a dish of porridge. And
                  not until the day when mamma was much later than usual, had it ever occurred to me
                  that uncle might have a family.</p>
               <p>He had always been alone in his quiet kingdom of dreams when we
                  arrived in mid morning, and we had left him in similar, cheerful peace, at five in
                  the afternoon. On this occasion, however, a tall, angular lady, in a long black
                  dress that poked out at the back, like the hump on the kitty when something scared
                  him, swept in on a gust of cold wind.</p>
               <p>‘Skotan’s vedur!’ cried she, kicking the door shut with her heel,
                  for there was a big bag in one hand and an umbrella in the other. The autumn wind
                  was cold, but she was colder, I thought, watching her put away the umbrella, the
                  bag, and the stiff black hat from the top of her head, and hang up her jacket,
                  that had a thousand buttons from chin to stomach. The wind was dreadful, the
                  streets were dreadful, the dressmaking shop where she worked was dreadful—in fact,
                  everything in this dreadful place worse than dreadful, she said, in a
                  running-river voice that raised the gooseflesh on my skin.</p>
               <p>Striding to my dignified uncle, she kissed the top of his head,
                  yanked the pillow he liked under the small of his back up under his
                  shoulder-blades, and, with a crack of a smile in her thin, sallow face, said
                  smartly:</p>
               <p>‘That’s better! How are the feet? Were you cold? Did you eat the
                  sole I fixed for your lunch?’</p>
               <p>Then, as if seeing me for the first time, she exclaimed, eyeing me
                  severely: ‘So that is Lala! Goodness, child, what makes your face so red? I hope
                  you aren’t getting a nasty fever!’</p>
               <p>‘The little thing is shy, Bella,’ uncle defended me.</p>
               <p>‘Nonsense! Don’t put ideas in her head,’ Bella retorted. ‘Here,
                  child, you need not be shy with me. Come, I’ll fix you a nice drink to cool your
                  blood.’</p>
               <p>I did not want anything to drink, but when she reached out a
                  strong, lean hand for me, I went along to the pantry. I remember the rites of that
                  drink to the last detail. She took a glass, into which she poured a little
                  vinegar, added a spoonful of sugar, some water, and a pinch of soda to make it
                  fizz.</p>
               <p>It had a dreadful taste, but I knew better than not to drink it,
                  and said, besides, ‘Thank you,’ as bravely as I could.</p>
               <p>On the way home, that evening, I plucked up courage to question
                  mamma. ‘Who is Bella?’ I wanted to know.</p>
               <p>‘Bella is your uncle’s wife,’ mamma astonished me by saying. And
                  then I saw that she was laughing in a silent way, that she always had when greatly
                  amused. So I dared to add:</p>
               <p>‘But, mamma—uncle is awfully old!’</p>
               <p>‘That was the trouble,’ she said. ‘Yes—that was the trouble.’</p>
               <p>There the matter rested. Years later, I was to hear a common
                  version of that belated marriage. Uncle Jonathan had been caught in a weak moment,
                  while he was ill! Too old for adventure, and retired from the sea, Bella’s
                  practical ministrations were doubtless a welcome panacea for his loneliness. A
                  good wife she proved, at that! So my mother always declaimed, a bit militantly. A
                  good, sensible wife, who cared for him in sickness and health. But I, who
                  remembered the twinkling castanets, that danced for him in the prairie rain,
                  sometimes wondered—for what had a bed, and a fire, and a piece of fried sole, to
                  do with happiness?</p>

               <p>These happy days came to an end. My father was home from the
                  hospital, and, although far from well, was soon at work again. There was no one
                  now to whom I could tell my thoughts. Mamma was for ever busy. She had a passion
                  for keeping things scoured and scrubbed. Even the stove had its face rubbed until
                  it shone like a mirror. When you carried water from a pump half a block away, or
                  melted snow after the winter had set in, all this washing and cleaning consumed a
                  lot of time. Moreover, these household activities were only the beginning of
                  mamma’s labours. There were endless socks and stockings and mitts to knit, besides
                  clothes to be mended and made for others.</p>
               <p>The knitting had compensations. It was generally dusk before she
                  got round to it, and then she would pull up the high-backed rocking-chair to the
                  side of the shiny black stove, where the kettle hummed its own little tune and the
                  cat purred under the fire-box. It was fun to draw up my little chair, too, and
                  watch the glinting needles fly in mamma’s small, pretty hands. She was proud of
                  those hands, and proud of her beautiful, chestnut hair, coiled in heavy braids at
                  the back of her head. She had other pride, as well, which I could not then
                  understand. And yet, when she sat there, small, and straight, and still, in her
                  high-backed chair, I always half expected she might wave her hand, like the good
                  queen who put down gibbets, and, in a trice, transform the sad old house. And
                  quite often something not unlike that did happen.</p>
               <p>For mamma would tell me a story. Not the saucy sort of yarn that
                  great-uncle loved to unfold with lavish detail, and laughter in his eye. There
                  were no twinkling toes and fleeting gallantries in mamma’s sagas. While the cat
                  purred and the kettle sang, I was made to feel how seldom the high-hearted pursued
                  the pleasant paths of common happiness. Heroes fell upon their swords, forsworn to
                  honour, and their ladies, equally stern, shunned such ignoble weaknesses as tears
                  and lamentation.</p>
               <p>There was Brynhild, the gleaming warrior maid; Isolde the Unlucky;
                  and Gudrid the Fair—though what was fair about a maid so full of vengeance, I
                  never could see. Her wilful story cast a chill on my child heart, and yet, when
                  mamma recited the famous confession Gudrid made to her son, when she was old, and
                  become a holy recluse, tears choked me: ‘Now will I tell thee this: to him was I
                  worst whom best I loved!’</p>
               <p>There was something grandly tragic beyond my ken in those sagas. I
                  heard them with interest, not unmixed with awesome fear. What I liked much better
                  were the times when mamma brought out the spinning-wheel, and I sat at her feet,
                  carding tufts of wool, listening to the fascinating histories of Snow White and
                  Rose Red and the Seven Dwarfs, Kitty, the King’s Daughter, and the pretty tale of
                  Laufey and Lineik.</p>
               <p>There came a morning, however, that put an end to these lovely
                  pleasures for quite some time. I awakened with a horrible, choking sensation, that
                  rapidly increased. My body was on fire, my head spun with queer noises, and
                  nothing that any one could do eased the growing misery. The old doctor who had
                  dosed us for simple ailments wrung his hands in despair. He had thought this a
                  case of aggravated croup, he said, but now he surmised that the ‘infant-killer’
                  had picked me for its victim. It was diphtheria!</p>
               <p>My poor parents looked at each other in fear. If he had said it was
                  the bubonic plague their hearts would have suffered no greater chill. For, in
                  those not so distant days, diphtheria was almost as fatal a scourge. If only we
                  were nearer the centres of civilization, the old doctor moaned. He had read of an
                  anti-toxin just discovered, that was being used with miraculous effects. But we
                  were not on the highroads of civilization. We were in an isolated frontier town,
                  far from all such blessings.</p>
               <p>That I am still alive to tell the tale is certainly due to a
                  singular circumstance. A friend of my mother who lived at a considerable distance,
                  was suddenly obsessed by the feeling that she should visit us. It was very cold,
                  and, so far as she knew, there was no particular reason for the nagging urgency
                  that oppressed her. By all the rules of common sense, she should have waited for
                  decent weather. But neither common sense, nor the prospect of a long, tiresome
                  walk in sub-zero weather, was strong enough to obliterate that odd feeling of
                  urgent need calling her. At twilight, she could resist the pull no longer, and
                  started out, feeling a little foolish but determined to act on the driving
                  impulse.</p>
               <p>Once inside our stricken house, this wonderful woman took matters
                  into her own hands. She sent for her own physician, Dr. Chown, at that time one of
                  Winnipeg’s outstanding medical men. Neither prestige nor poverty affected his
                  zeal. He fought for life as grimly and tirelessly as a soldier fights for the
                  shining thing he calls honour, on whatever battle-front. Dr. Chown literally
                  leaped at the case, because the odds were all against him—if there were even one
                  chance in a thousand, he meant to fight for that chance. And so the long struggle
                  began.</p>
               <p>What frantic measures were attempted are of no particular
                  consequence now. But I remember, with ineradicable vividness, the first of many
                  evils. I remember the insufferable tent, made of heavy blankets, where my father
                  was to hold me over a tub of boiling water, kept at white steam heat with hot
                  stones. I remember it so well because, in my choking agony, I clutched at papa and
                  moaned: ‘Take me out, papa—I’m gone any way!’ Yes, I remember it, for suddenly my
                  father’s tears were a cooling rain on my burning face, and the smothering walls
                  fell away. . . .</p>
               <p>Dr. Chown eventually called in a young surgeon whose reputation was
                  already enviable. What his exact theory was, in regard to this particular case,
                  only heaven knows. But he decided that the most feasible way of saving me was by
                  the insertion of some sort of tube into my throat—presumably to act as a
                  repository for the phlegm and poisonous secretions. It was to remain not more than
                  twelve hours. Thereafter, the pressure would be too great.</p>
               <p>The brilliant surgeon may have been overly busy—those were days of
                  an under-staffed hospital—or he may simply have forgotten that an immigrant’s
                  child was battling for life in an obscure corner of the town. At any rate, he
                  failed to return in the twelve hours. But when Dr. Chown made his call, that awful
                  morning, he took just one glimpse of the purple, squirming bundle that fought for
                  breath, bleeding at the nostrils, mouth, and even the finger nails, and out he
                  flew to his rig, and across town, in a mad chase that was to become history in our
                  slice of the world.</p>
               <p>A chastened surgeon returned with him. Somehow, that frightfully
                  entangled device was literally torn up from my tortured throat. How, I mercifully
                  never knew, for nature had done what medicine dared not do—I was unconscious.</p>
               <p>The point of all this came much later. One morning, awakening from
                  a foggy sleep, I overheard voices: ‘She will live,’ some one said, ‘but I’m afraid
                  her voice may be lost—that she may not speak——’</p>
               <p>Terror, such as only a helpless child can know, almost stopped my
                  heart. Oh, I knew the meaning of those whispered words. Never to sing at the top
                  of my voice when I was alone in the house and mamma busy elsewhere. Never to
                  speak, even to myself, the crowding thoughts that flocked to my head. I opened my
                  mouth to scream, only to find how right the whisperers were. No sound came out!
                  Frozen with fear, I lay there, my little body too weak to move, and the voices
                  going on and on just beyond the doorway. It was then, all at once, that something
                  fierce, something stronger than fear, rushed to my aid. I remembered those stories
                  told on an empty apple box. I would not lose my voice. No, no, I would not! I had
                  to have a voice to go on telling Uncle Jonathan my little stories. . . .</p>
               <p>When my mother came in, I was crying soundlessly. That was another
                  thing I must not do, I was told. It would hinder my getting strong again. I must
                  be quiet, and very, very still. I must go on patiently taking the endless broths,
                  fed with a spoon, and swallow without complaint the syrupy stuff, bitter sweet,
                  from the big brown bottle the doctor had left.</p>
               <p>Days and nights dragged out their endless length. Except for the
                  visits of the doctor who each morning left something in my numb little hands: a
                  yellow orange; a bright red apple; and sometimes a silver shiny coin; nothing
                  relieved the pain-filled monotony. The nights were the worst, however, for then,
                  so often, I broke into a sweat, reliving the choking horror, and all that went
                  with it. Those nights would have been an unrelieved nightmare, but for my
                  faithful, black cat, who so often crept into my bed, and, quite as though he
                  understood my misery, snuggled, warm and loving, close to my troubled heart.</p>
               <p>My father had lost many days’ work while I was so desperately ill,
                  and now was compelled to work overtime, late into the night, in the futile hope
                  that somehow or other he could thereby meet the cost of this protracted illness.
                  His worry must have communicated, itself to Dr. Chown, who, perhaps, understood
                  that one may be poor with honour, and that the handicap of language does not
                  necessarily condemn one to insensitive ignorance. At any rate, one Sunday Dr.
                  Chown simulated the greatest interest in a chest of drawers papa had made from an
                  old oak bed. It was marvellously done, he said. Papa’s bookshelves were another
                  wonder—although made from nothing better than cheap pine boards. Now, if only he
                  could get flower-boxes made as well as that, said the doctor, sighing. But, of
                  course, skilled craftsmen in any line were not to be picked up for odd jobs like
                  that. Naturally, my father understood what genuine human goodness prompted these
                  reflections. Very gladly he made the doctor’s flower-boxes, and what else the
                  generous physician invented as his need. But papa was not prepared to receive, for
                  these inadequate tasks, a cancelled bill! Such kindness had not been our
                  experience in Canada. It was a miracle that melted some of mamma’s bitterness
                  against what had always been little better than humiliating exile. There were
                  tears in papa’s eyes when he told her of it, and I remember the white look of her
                  face when she answered:</p>
               <p>‘So then—there are gentlefolk in this country!’</p>
               <p>No doubt, she was thinking back to her old home at Reygholt, in the
                  famous deanery, where life moved with dignity, and charity was something more than
                  a pious word. To that ancient, historic estate, where a noble Norse chieftain had
                  raised his booths and written his famous laws, and where, in later times,
                  dignitaries or the Church pursued their homely ways, cherishing many admirable
                  customs. Kindly customs, such as the house-readings, of which mamma so often
                  spoke, when all the household assembled in the badstoffa, and
                  the old dean read from the ancient sagas, from poetry, or holy writ. And, always,
                  at the close, in that quaint household, the mistress and her daughters waited on
                  the servants, for this was their hour of respite, and the little courtesy an
                  unspoken reminder of the Greatest Servant, who came, not to be served, but to
                  serve others.</p>
               <p>That way of life, almost feudal in its dignity, and fixed,
                  substantial habits, my mother never forgot—and, perhaps, never forgave herself for
                  leaving, as she had done on a romantic impulse, and against her people’s wishes.
                  But of that, I as yet knew nothing, nor could then have understood. I only knew
                  that Dr. Chown softened her attitude toward the new country, and perhaps raised a
                  hope that one day her children might redeem themselves from the bitter bondage of
                  straitened circumstances. For never, like my incurably idealistic father, could
                  she console herself with poetic fancies—believe any but concrete deeds were of any
                  particular value. One kindly, quiet deed eclipsed a million easy sympathies, in
                  her estimation. And good impulses froze in the human heart when one’s
                  circumstances prevented their natural expression. So she believed, and, neither
                  then nor at any future time, was she ever to modify that opinion.</p>
               <p>The doctor’s generosity had relieved my parents of a financial
                  burden, but the anxiety over my voice still remained. Six weeks had passed, and
                  not a sound came from my stricken throat. I was able to be up a few hours daily,
                  and in all other respects was well on the way to recovery, although the doctor
                  predicted bronchial difficulties, and urged the most stringent care. Kind friends
                  came and patted me on the head, and said what a good child I was. Certainly, I was
                  passive enough, and quiet enough, for there was nothing left of the lively spirit
                  that had spun such enchanting vagaries in uncle’s fairy kingdom. I was no longer
                  so frightened at being mute, for I had acquired a sort of infant stoicism, and by
                  some instinctive reasoning accepted the futility of expecting any one to
                  understand what really troubled me. But I so often wept furtively, when left to
                  myself, thinking of those happy days in the little house that held an entire
                  world.</p>
               <p>There came a day, however, which has a place by itself in memory.
                  Mamma had dressed me in the red cashmere frock she had made to celebrate my
                  recovery. Round my neck was a string of white beads from papa, and on my feet
                  little patent-leather slippers he had made after working hours. My long, yellow
                  hair was tied back from my forehead with a fine new ribbon, and once again the
                  time had come to take a special medicine and try my voice. Mamma drew up my little
                  chair to her knees, and, when I was seated, poured out the sticky substance for me
                  to swallow.</p>
               <p>‘Now try to say something, child,’ she urged, as she had gently
                  urged a hundred times before. Suddenly, I was afraid—terribly afraid. I had tried
                  so often. Without much hope, my lips parted. I don’t know what I meant to say. I
                  only remember the shock of amazed delight, when a thin, wavering squeak sounded in
                  my ears. And then, all at once, I was in mamma’s lap, crying and crying, her arms
                  tight, tight about me.</p>
               <p>In a really smart chronicle, any struggle ends at a prescribed
                  climax, preferably with a happy recompense for all concerned, save the wilful
                  sinner. But, unfortunately for the artistry of this tale, life is not smart. Life
                  is a colossus too great for smart declensions, and as indifferent to human
                  vanities as to individual destiny. It cares nothing for the canons of art, and
                  pursues its ironic rhythm, piling up anticlimaxes as a tidal wave piles up the
                  wreckage it has made of some once seaworthy ship.</p>
               <p>It would certainly be more agreeable, and, in the happy convention,
                  to end the vicissitudes of my childhood with the recovery of my voice, and some
                  divinely ordered recompense. But, as a matter of fact, that unforgettable illness
                  was only the beginning of a prolonged Job’s cycle—a sort of melodramatic
                  introduction to years of intermittent suffering. And the only compensation, truth
                  compels me to acknowledge, was a gradual deadening of the acute sensitivity which
                  had registered so many earlier impressions. Each illness seemed to thrust me
                  deeper and deeper into a kind of mental stupor, which rendered the greater part of
                  those years a blank.</p>

               <p>The poor attract malicious fate. A few weeks after my recovery a
                  neighbour suggested to my mother that she should rent an upstairs room to a widow
                  who was seeking a modest shelter. When she arrived to inspect the room she brought
                  a child whose pasty complexion struck my mother as unhealthy.</p>
               <p>‘I hope your little girl isn’t unwell,’ she said to the woman. ‘I
                  have a child who is just recovering from a serious illness, and have to be
                  careful.’</p>
               <p>‘Oh, there is nothing wrong with Lena but a touch of cold,’ the
                  other said.</p>
               <p>The cold was whooping-cough! Mother never forgave that lie, and
                  promptly evicted the woman when the ugly truth came out. But the damage was done.
                  I had contracted the worst of all ailments, under the circumstances—one which left
                  me with a permanent bronchial weakness.</p>
               <p>Thereafter I was the prey of every raging epidemic. Those who
                  remember the institution of the Little White Hearse, which was a commonplace on
                  the streets of old Winnipeg, know the frequency of those epidemics and their fatal
                  virulence. Those were the good old days when every mother was warned against ‘the
                  second summer’ for her baby. When old wives stood ready with such simple remedies
                  as lime water, flour steamed in cotton sacks, the powdered inside of the caked
                  ball to be administered for dysentery. When camphor bags about the throat were
                  believed to lessen the chances of contagion, and paregoric was thought to have
                  beneficently soothing effects. When onion poultices, mustard baths, linseed packs,
                  and various homeopathic remedies were the order of the hour, and most doctors were
                  still very dubious about the possible effects of night air.</p>
               <p>In these partially enlightened times the ‘second summer’ myth
                  connotes sheer superstition, but there was ample justification for the belief in
                  the days when milk was peddled in cans from door to door, and dished out in quart
                  measures by indifferent delivery boys; when the water-supply came from wells in a
                  low, flat plain, where sewers were undreamed of, and the height of sanitary
                  arrangement was the swill wagon that nosed up and down the back street, like some
                  prehistoric monster, intent upon slaking its thirst from innumerable barrels round
                  which bluebottles sang an eternal dirge.</p>
               <p>That wagon ought to have been preserved for posterity. It was a
                  huge affair, with a long, canvas-covered rubber hose that swayed to and fro, like
                  the trunk of an elephant, as it lurched up and down the rutted back lanes, drawn
                  by a team of heavy percherons. You could hear its thunderous
                  approach, punctuated by regular gurgles as it pursued its civic passage from
                  barrel to barrel.</p>
               <p>The actual process was a perpetual interest. The horses came to a
                  stop, dropped their heads for a wink in the sun, and the driver leaped nimbly down
                  from the wagon seat. Whistling cheerily, he removed the burlap cover from the
                  reeking barrel, and, unhooking the trunk, inserted it into the boiling sour
                  contents—and kept on whistling, while the monster glug-glugged contentedly.</p>
               <p>There were other back-yard conveyances, that moved in the night, to
                  save the sensibilities of the citizen, which are better left to the imagination.
                  But some idea may be gathered of the plague of flies that swarmed over lane and
                  alley of whatsoever section of the town. On the outskirts, small dairies, and the
                  thrifty individual of whom sentimentalists sing such praises to-day, added their
                  unpleasant quota by way of chicken-runs, pigsties, and the family cow. In town, it
                  was little better. Almost every block had a livery barn, with its malodorous
                  accumulation uncontested by civic authorities. It was indeed a fragrant time! Even
                  the rich had no defence, other than stands of Manitoba elms or maples, that
                  screened the rear of their Victorian houses from similar, unsightly manifestations
                  of wealth outside the barn and coach-house door.</p>
               <p>In those good old days, which the reactionary likes to believe were
                  an idyllic interlude of healthful, simple living, scarcely a day passed without
                  the appearance of the Little White Hearse, with its smart span of grey horses,
                  before some doorway flying a long white crêpe. And, if the
                  peril of ‘second summer’ was successfully averted, the ever recurring epidemics of
                  measles, chicken-pox, scarlet fever, and bronchial pneumonia waited, unseen and
                  unpredictable enemies, to pounce upon the growing child.</p>
               <p>Fortunately for most of us, the subconscious mind has its own
                  beneficent defence mechanism, which enables us to inhibit and forget what would be
                  intolerable to remember. In any case, those dreary years are a vague interval,
                  where only an occasional event stands out from the grey panorama of seemingly
                  unrelated happenings, and even these memorable bits are unrelated and refuse to
                  appear in any sort of chronological order.</p>
               <p>Sometimes these incidents had to do with little trips I made with
                  my father to the Hudson Bay Company, where a chilling sort of dignity seemed to
                  hover over the jumbled merchandise, and greasy squaws and incredibly wrinkled old
                  men sat smoking on the curb before the door. On one such occasion, in early
                  spring, when the Red River was dangerously high and the citizens were marking its
                  angry progress with anxious eyes, father pointed out for me a tall, sardonic
                  Indian who was strutting up and down the river bank.</p>
               <p>‘That’s Laughing Joe,’ papa said. ‘No doubt he is waiting for a
                  larger audience. When there are enough to make it worth while, you’ll hear the Red
                  Man’s version of Paleface mirth.’</p>
               <p>As papa said, when enough idlers had gathered to justify the
                  performance, Old Joe threw down his hat, with a horrible leer which was doubtless
                  intended as polite persuasion, and certainly brought results. ‘The old wretch
                  looks capable of murder,’ said a man, as he tossed a coin into the tattered hat.
                  Other coins followed in a fleet silver shower. When satisfied his talent was
                  sufficiently rewarded, Old Joe threw back his unkempt head, opened his mouth in a
                  hippopotamus yawn, and was off on a round of laughter that rocked his whole body
                  and made his listeners instinctively draw closer to one another, however broadly
                  they grinned.</p>
               <p>As for me, I clung to my father’s coat tails, waiting for the
                  thunder to cease. A little later, when papa and I sat under a red willow bush,
                  watching the muddy waters coiling by, I said:</p>
               <p>‘That wasn’t happy laughter, was it, papa?’</p>
               <p>‘No, child,’ papa smiled, patting my hand. ‘Old Joe hasn’t much to
                  be happy about—least of all, when he imitates the white man’s cruel laughter.’</p>
               <p>‘Why is it cruel, papa?’ I wanted to know.</p>
               <p>‘Because it is always cruel to laugh in the face of misery,’ said
                  papa. ‘But that is something conquerors never trouble to know.’</p>
               <p>Another time, we went to the immigrant sheds to meet some
                  Icelanders who were arriving from ‘home’, and had neither relatives nor friends in
                  this country. It was not unusual for such people to write to my father, for he was
                  known through his writings in the Icelandic periodicals, and he seemed to take it
                  for granted that he should help these strangers through the ordeal of endless
                  questionings, medical inspection, customs ritual, and, finally, steer them to some
                  sort of temporary quarters.</p>
               <p>It was Sunday, on this occasion. In one respect, this was a happy
                  circumstance, for it meant no loss of time from his work at the saddlery, where he
                  eked out a meagre living under the time-honoured piecework system beloved of all
                  sweat-shop autocrats. On the other hand, it meant precious hours away from his
                  hobby, from the one thing that kept him alive—his cherished writing.</p>
               <p>‘Six days, I may be a slave,’ papa used to say. ‘On Sunday, I am my
                  own man, and live to please myself.’</p>
               <p>It was quite a ritual. Breakfast coffee over, he shined his shoes,
                  washed, put on his white shirt, dark trousers, and a rusty old Prince Albert, and
                  when he was sure not a hair was out of place, his moustache neatly trimmed and his
                  tie perfectly straight, he pocketed his silver snuff-box, and, cane in hand, set
                  out for a little walk. Sometimes he went to church—preferably to the Unitarian
                  Meeting House, where ideas, not emotions, were exploited. Sometimes he called on a
                  sick friend. But, invariably, when he came back, and dinner was over and done, he
                  retired to his barren room to write for the rest of the day, perfectly contented,
                  and unconscious of what went on in the rest of the house.</p>
               <p>Now, however, he had to visit the immigrant sheds. It was a warm
                  summer’s day, with not a cloud in the sky, or a murmur of wind. The air would do
                  me good, he told mamma, a little defiantly. That was another bone of contention
                  between them. Papa maintained I should run about more freely, but my poor mother,
                  always terrified that I might go the way of her other babies, would have wrapped
                  me in mothballs and locked me in a glass case if she could. This time, the perfect
                  weather and a patchwork quilt she was eager to finish spoke in our favour. So
                  there I was, dressed in a clean pinafore, with ruffles on the shoulders that stood
                  out like wings, and my pigtails neat, yellow ropes bobbing from under a little
                  straw hat, walking sedately beside papa, who had faithfully promised to keep a
                  slow pace, so that I should not get a fit of coughing from breathlessness.</p>
               <p>There was really no danger of excessive haste. Papa knew his own
                  weakness, and had set off in ample time. A few houses down the street a stout
                  woman was picking marigolds in her patch of garden. She was puffing and blowing,
                  and red as a beet, and her mouse-coloured hair straggled down from a hard knot at
                  the back of her neck. Papa stopped, leaning on his cane.</p>
               <p>‘How fine you look, Marta,’ said he, with a hint of flattering
                  surprise. ‘My, my, what flowers! It is easy to see you have the touch a lovely
                  garden needs.’</p>
               <p>Marta stifled a gasp, as she straightened her cricked back, mopping
                  a wet brow, and smiled at papa.</p>
               <p>‘I’m not so bad, thank God,’ said she. ‘But those devils of
                  cutworms come up in droves after the rain—and that was quite a shower we had last
                  night. Three or four o’clock it was, I know, for I hadn’t shut an eye, what with
                  my bad leg, and Benjamin a snorer.’</p>
               <p>‘Those are beautiful flowers,’ papa interrupted an impending
                  deluge, pointing to a bed of sweet-william and verbena.</p>
               <p>‘Brightish, kind of,’ Marta agreed. ‘If I didn’t see you are
                  visiting-bent, I’d give you some, and welcome—maybe the little one would like a
                  posy any way.’</p>
               <p>‘Your heart is as good as your garden, Marta,’ papa rejoined. ‘I’d
                  be glad of a few flowers, if you can spare them. We are off to the immigrant
                  sheds—you know how it is for the stranger.’</p>
               <p>‘What a thoughtful soul you are!’ exclaimed Marta, and set to work
                  selecting her choicest flowers for a fragrant offering. With these in my arms, we
                  continued our leisurely way.</p>
               <p>Safely out of earshot, I said: ‘Papa, did you really want these—for
                  the strangers?’</p>
               <p>‘Perhaps not, Lala,’ papa smiled at me. ‘Perhaps I wanted the old
                  woman to be happy. It makes people happy, to share beautiful things.’</p>
               <p>Our next stop was a corner store, where papa bought a little round
                  carton of snuff, and a red apple for me. The storekeeper limped with sciatica, and
                  papa recommended ‘cupping’, and a bitter. In Dakota, papa had had a pain in the
                  back, and a cupping had drawn off the fever. ‘Sure, I believe you,’ said the
                  storekeeper, but where in Winnipeg was a good ‘cupper’ to be found? No one
                  cultivated the old healing arts in this country. Why, you couldn’t even get your
                  ears pierced to draw off the soreness from watery eyes!</p>
               <p>A street or two farther on, a big man with a ruddy complexion and
                  Dundreary whiskers met us at an intersection. ‘Ha! Ha! Lars Gudman! Why aren’t you
                  at the meeting-house?’ he demanded truculently, and glowering.</p>
               <p>‘I wanted to keep the peace,’ said papa. ‘It’s a pleasant pastime.
                  I’d recommend it even to a man of God.’</p>
               <p>‘You’re a saucy fellow,’ the big man retorted. Then, a grin
                  spreading over his face, he added: ‘None the less, I wish you’d recommend it to my
                  daughters—the baggages are quite out of hand. Inga won’t get married like a
                  sensible girl, and Sofie wants to start a bake-shop!’</p>
               <p>‘My, my! Little Inga is in a bad way,’ papa twinkled. ‘But the shop
                  seems a womanly venture.’</p>
               <p>‘Baggages! Baggages!’ roared the big man. ‘If they were boys, I’d
                  birch them. But you can’t beat a woman, and they know it! Where are you going, may
                  I ask?’</p>
               <p>‘To the immigrant sheds. Perhaps you’d like to come?’</p>
               <p>‘Not I! I’ve no heart to greet a parcel of fools. Why don’t they
                  stay home? They’ll end up in the harvest fields and the ditches! Well, if you
                  can’t find a roof for all of them, there is a bed in my attic,’ the big man
                  concluded, tweeked my ear gently, and trod away, frowning.</p>
               <p>At last we neared the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers,
                  and saw, down on the bank, the long, low structure that was the immigrant shed. I
                  don’t remember much about it, except that it was a grimy, forbidding place, with
                  dirty windows and battered doors. We stepped out of the brilliant prairie sunshine
                  into a grey gloom, and exchanged the sweet summer air for a stale, indescribable
                  smell, which haunts me to this day. It was a sickening compound of rancid oils and
                  animal odours that seemed to be carried on every faintest current of breeze from
                  the room which gave off the small information office wherein we stood.</p>
               <p>Papa coughed, took out his snuff-box, hastily inhaled a pinch of
                  the pungent powder, coughed again, and hurried to the information desk. Yes, the
                  Icelanders had arrived, the clerk informed him. They were waiting in the second
                  room to the right. Papa glanced dubiously towards the doorway whence the evil
                  smells drifted.</p>
               <p>‘Go ahead,’ the man told him. ‘Just a bunch of Doukabors in there.
                  There’s nothing to stop you.’</p>
               <p>No, there was nothing to stop us, except a hundred human forms
                  stretched out upon the dirty floor, close-packed as locusts in a year of plague.
                  Strange, human bundles, which, to my terrified glance, seemed more like animals,
                  than men, for they were all wrapped in greyish, woolly, skin garments, that reeked
                  with horrible odour. That they were human beings I realized, however, as we picked
                  our way, stepping over a sprawling leg or outflung arm or an entire inert form.
                  Sometimes, a heavy head would lift from its sheepskin collar, and eyes like coals
                  stare at us out of a thicket of matted hair and beard. Sometimes, a beardless face
                  turned on us, vacantly, blinked empty eyes, and dropped back to the comfort of a
                  sheepskin sleeve, or the hill of a smaller bundle, which may have been a child, or
                  a tightly rolled feather tick.</p>
               <p>To my excited fancy, they seemed a race of hairy monsters, stewing
                  in their own reek, like the animals in a circus. I could not skip through them
                  fast enough. That is how I came to trip, sprawling on a huge fellow who lay
                  spilled out in peace just inside the door I was so eager to reach. Of course, I
                  lost my Marta’s gift of flowers, and if I didn’t scream, it was because the fright
                  was shocked out of me when the huge bolster jacked-up like a spring, and the big,
                  bearded face stared at me, crinkled with smiles. What was more, the surprising
                  creature retrieved the bouquet of flowers, which had fallen behind him. Before he
                  could hand them back, however, as was his evident intention, a woman beside him
                  snatched them from his hand, and buried her hot, grimy face in their sweet
                  petals.</p>
               <p>‘Come, child,’ papa’s voice called me.</p>
               <p>‘But, papa, my flowers——’</p>
               <p>Then I saw that papa was smiling in a queer way at the woman, who
                  seemed to be seeing nothing but the little bunch of flowers from a prairie
                  garden.</p>
               <p>‘Come, my dear,’ he repeated, softly.</p>

            <div>
               <head>Treasured Portrait</head>
               <p>The arrival of the peddler was always a pleasant break in the daily
                  monotony. For many seasons our part of town was covered by a little Italian woman,
                  whom I called ‘Mrs. Yes-mam’, because ‘yes ma’m’, ‘no ma’m’, punctuated every
                  other phrase that rippled from her agile tongue, and it struck me as highly
                  amusing, for I had no knowledge of English, and thought it a form of expletive,
                  like Herra Gud. She was always welcome, even if our purchase
                  was nothing more than a spool of thread or a paper of safety-pins for the latest
                  baby. She was small, and extremely dark, with alert, black eyes that must once
                  have been extremely fine, and heavy, raven hair that was as neatly arranged as
                  wind and weather permitted. She wore bright cotton clothes in summer, green and
                  red usually, the blouse set off with strings of coloured beads that dangled down
                  her bosom, and there was always a little gold cross at her withered throat. The
                  skirt was full, gathered into the waistband all around, and sometimes an apron of
                  black sateen, with bias bands of red and green tape at the bottom, completed the
                  garb. But what fascinated me were the big brass ear-rings that swung against her
                  sallow cheeks as she bobbed up and down, displaying her wares.</p>
               <p>Yes-mam carried an ingenious pack. It was made of oilcloth, and
                  opened and shut like a tobacco pouch, by means of innumerable curtain rings and a
                  stout linen cord. When she threw the pack to the floor, all the rings jangled
                  gaily, and put one in an expectant mood. Yes-mam never made the mistake of opening
                  the pack at once. She hovered above it like a protective Byzantine angel in a
                  plate-glass window, waving her nubbed arms up and down like attenuated wings, and
                  declaimed upon the weather, the gumbo, the latest plague, and hoped that the Holy
                  Mother of God had kept all evil from our house.</p>
               <p>When she opened the tantalizing pack it was done with a smart
                  flourish: a quick pull on a string, and lo! the mysterious contents lay before
                  you, and a delectable perfume assailed your nostrils. That perfume of the pack was
                  something to remember. It was the democratic incense of coloured soaps, sachet
                  bags, bottles of toilet water, hair tonic, and those now forgotten scented hearts,
                  which the knowing maidens of the day wore in their bosoms. I remember them well,
                  for mamma bought me one to wear round my neck at a church concert. It was made of
                  some shiny, filigree stuff, and enclosed a purple waxy substance that smelled very
                  pleasantly of English lavender. I wore it on a string of purple baby ribbon, and
                  thought myself very fine indeed.</p>
               <p>There were other luxuries in Yes-mam’s pack. Silk handkerchiefs,
                  embroidered with butterflies and birds and exotic flowers of every hue. They were
                  fine silk, and the workmanship such as one rarely sees to-day on a similar type of
                  handkerchief. There were cheap ones, to be sure. Five- and ten-cent scraps of silk
                  with gaudy cabbage roses in the corner. But sometimes Yes-mam displayed a square
                  of ivory-coloured silk, beautiful as the petals of a rose, sewn with hair-like
                  silks in the most delicate shades, which some skilled Chinese lady must have
                  worked long hours to execute. There were shawls, too, in that mysterious pack, of
                  soft wool and cashmere, and Bulgarian silk; cards of lace, both fine and coarse;
                  crochet cottons; mending wool; aprons; and, of course, stockings of black lisle
                  for women, and of stoutest cotton for children; mitts with rainbow tops:
                  comforters for baby; spools of thread; and an assortment of tape, rick-rack braid,
                  and needles and pins; with sometimes strings of rosaries at the bottom of the
                  notions tray, completing the store.</p>
               <p>We seldom had money to buy any of these alluring treasures, but
                  Yes-mam never passed our house, for she was always sure of a cup of hot coffee and
                  a welcome rest. If she happened to come on a day when papa was home, either too
                  sick to work or on a half-day taken to make something for the house—a cupboard or
                  chest, or simply to sole our shoes, the visit stretched to several cups, and all
                  manner of confidences. Papa had a friendly interest in everybody. He could ask
                  more questions, without offence, than any one I have ever known. In no time at all
                  perfect strangers confessed their secret sorrows and dearest ambitions. Mamma
                  always deplored this habit. If it were not downright impertinent, it was certainly
                  insincere, she contended. Papa could not possibly be interested in the private
                  lives of individuals he might never even see again, she thought. He could not
                  possibly mean the flattering comforts he invented on the spur of the moment! But,
                  to papa, wiser than she knew, the moment was supremely important, and the measure
                  of sincerity and truth and good it brought about.</p>
               <p>Yes-mam found papa home with lumbago one chilly autumn day. She was
                  full of concern, and called upon the saints to exorcize the misery from papa’s
                  back. Ah, she knew what a bad back was! Years with the pack, bowing and scraping
                  at inhospitable doors, put a crink in the spine and aches like dagger-thrusts in
                  the old bones. ‘Poor woman! Poor woman!’ papa sympathized. It was curious how fate
                  tricked one, he said. Very curious! For, of course, it was easy to see that
                  Yes-mam had not always been a slave of the pack—a handsome woman like she.</p>
               <p>Yes-mam lifted her hands heavenwards. The signor said the truth.
                  There had been better days in the vineyards of Italy. Sunny skies, sunny
                  dreams—but always there was some one to care for. First, the little brothers and
                  sisters. Then, the old parents. And a girl’s heart gets her into trouble. Her
                  particular trouble was a good-for-nothing husband. But that was past and done. The
                  signor must understand she was not complaining. Life was hard, for a peddler, to
                  be sure, but she had her little shack down where the river sang to the willows all
                  night through. No, no, she was not complaining. There was nothing much troubling
                  her now, except the wretched behaviour of her sewing-machine. The devil had it in
                  a spell, to be sure, and not a stitch would it sew!</p>
               <p>Now, that was too much! said papa. The devil must be taken down a
                  peg. If the weather was clear to-morrow he would like to take a look at the
                  bewitched piece of machinery.</p>
               <p>Yes-mam called upon the saints to witness her gratitude to the
                  signor for the generous thought. He with a bad back! Yes, if she ever forgot, she
                  implored the holy ones to smite her on the spot. And in this exalted mood she
                  whipped out a yellow silk handkerchief, which she hoped the bambino would accept without price—though it cost twenty cents.</p>
               <p>That is how I came to visit Yes-mam’s shack, which perched like a
                  lone, grey cormorant on the river bank at Point Douglas. While papa tinkered with
                  the machine I had a lovely time playing with an enormous cat, and wondering what
                  ailed the saints, whose pained faces gazed at me mournfully from a dozen faded
                  prints on the walls. But there was one thing of beauty in that cluttered house: a
                  little image of a woman, whose delicately sculptured face was as serene as a
                  midsummer night. Who, of the heavenly company old Yes-mam implored, she
                  represented, I never knew. I only know the impression she made upon my youthful
                  imagination has remained through the years, lovely as a cameo cut from
                  alabaster.</p>

               <head>I Meet the August Ancestors</head>
               <p>A child’s mental life is essentially egotistical. It revolves
                  around its own emotions and sense impressions, untouched by the wider awareness
                  which distinguishes the adult from the infant. A child is in the world, yet not of
                  it, for his sense extensions are limited and weak. He swims about in the waters of
                  his own emotions as unconscious of the outer world as a goldfish in its little
                  glass bowl.</p>
               <p>A series of sad jolts might, conceivably, increase the sensitivity
                  of a goldfish—a cat clawing the water would no doubt inspire a spurt of
                  exceptional energy. There was always something stirring the quiet of my private
                  world. This something had, generally, a sting that whipped my small mental
                  processes to the point where I found myself dimly aware that strange, alien powers
                  existed beyond my little bowl.</p>
               <p>There was the place where papa worked, for instance. It exercised a
                  definite spell, which cast an uneasy shadow on the whole house. Before six in the
                  morning papa set out with his lunch-box and bottle of coffee, and whenever he was
                  well enough, he remained in this mysterious place until nine or ten o’clock at
                  night. That his many illnesses were somehow connected with these strange visits I
                  began to suspect, for he was always so tired when he came home. And sometimes
                  there was a grey look in his face that made him seem a stranger. I was usually
                  awake, for my cough tormented me, and often, too, I had bilious attacks that
                  prevented sleep, and so nothing would do but I must sit on papa’s knee for a
                  minute.</p>
               <p>I remember those ghostly nights, when the kitchen lamp, turned low
                  to save coal oil, struggled against the dark, and the stove made equally
                  inadequate headway against the cold. Papa was often too tired to eat anything,
                  though mamma always had a kettle of soup or porridge waiting for him. He ought to
                  eat, she said; there was no nourishment in bread and coffee. And soup was the
                  mainstay. Boiling beef or brisket with potatoes made a fine dish, the broth
                  thickened with flour or a dash of oatmeal, and sometimes stepped up with an onion
                  or a turnip when the budget permitted such luxuries.</p>
               <p>Yes, he ought to eat. Papa knew that, but how could a man eat when
                  his whole body ached and his lungs felt clogged with dust and his senses reeled
                  with weariness? How could you sit for almost fourteen hours at a bench, stitching
                  by hand the heaviest traces, fighting time for a few cents because it meant life
                  for your family—stitching, stitching, stitching, with the devil at your heels, a
                  sort of frozen despair in your heart, and come away with enough life even to feel
                  hunger?</p>
               <p>Yes, mamma knew that it was hard to keep one’s soul alive in this
                  harsh country. She was sympathetic and cheerful, though at times a note of
                  bitterness, not unmixed with accusation, coloured her sentiment. In a vague way, I
                  understood that this feeling had its source in something far beyond my tiny
                  goldfish bowl. It had to do with the incomprehensible world in which mamma lived
                  before I was born, which was harder for me to visualize as tangible and real, for
                  mamma referred to it seldom, than the glamorous reign of the Ancestors, on whose
                  achievements she liked to dwell. They too were outside my small, immediate world,
                  but represented a ghostly court of equity, to whom it was my duty to refer the
                  record of my deeds and misdeeds.</p>
               <p>The old-fashioned Icelander, like the ancient Chinese, does not
                  cherish his ancestors idly. It is not with him a question of recounting with pride
                  achievements once illustrious and long forgotten, for nothing better than
                  pleasurable vanity. One walked warily before this ghostly assembly, and shuddered
                  to be found wanting in commendable behaviour. Consciously and unconsciously, my
                  mother’s judgements were invariably coloured by this final court of appeal.</p>
               <p>Hardships she endured with exemplary courage, but no flight of
                  sentimental eloquence ever swayed her the slightest from what she believed as
                  right and becoming in the sight of that formidable company. Where my father would
                  have cheerfully opened his house to any one with no better hospitality than a cup
                  of coffee and some easy conversation, mother thought it beneath the dignity of
                  respectable behaviour thus to inflict one’s poverty on others. She had no gift for
                  light friendship, and preferred an old book to the companionship of indifferent
                  people.</p>
               <p>She was a woman descended from an ancient family, stiff-necked,
                  righteous, and unbending in their unconscious pride. The sagas record their
                  knightly deeds—bold, fearless, not always wise, yet never, I think, inconsistent
                  with the cold pride that impelled them. Gunnar Hamundson, the hereditary
                  chieftain, to whom the numerous branches of the family look back with justifiable
                  veneration, was the last of the great Vikings. By which I mean last of the Norse
                  nobles to acquit himself in the Viking manner, serving at court, sailing his own
                  dragon ship on seaways of adventure, presiding at parliament, keeping open house
                  in the regal style, paternal towards his dependents, keeping himself responsible
                  for their justice at Thingvellir, and, as a matter of course, the champion of his
                  less fortunate kinsman in all their quarrels. Immortalized in the sagas by reason
                  of his own attainments, his family was already old and established long before
                  they came to Iceland. Gunnar’s great-grandfather, Baugur Raudson, was one of the
                  Landnamsmonnum—the first band of nobles who took possession of the country and
                  established the old Norse Republic. His great-grandfather was Kjarvalur
                  (Ceabhall), a colourful chieftain, who, in the good old Irish fashion, dubbed
                  himself king of Ossory in Munster. He died there in 888.</p>
               <p>True to the sentiments of his race, Gunnar preferred to die at the
                  hands of his enemies rather than submit to a three-years’ banishment, although,
                  for so renowned a knight, the sentence would have resolved itself into nothing
                  more drastic than an extended visit at the court of the Norwegian king. But he
                  loved his Icelandic dales; and the green slopes of the little hills, where lacy
                  waterfalls came sweetly down from the crags above, were more precious in his sight
                  than the pageantries of any court. Against the counsel of his wisest friends, he
                  refused to fly. These heaths were his homeland. Why desert them because a feud of
                  which he was spiritually guiltless might lead to death?</p>
               <p>‘Death is not so great a matter,’ he contended. But the manner of
                  one’s dying—ah, that was something else. A man’s departure from the vanities of
                  existence ought to be consistent with the code he practices. ‘Aldrei ad
                  guggna!’</p>
               <p>They knew no compromise, those headstrong clansmen, and that
                  unyielding quality has characterized their descendants, often with ill effects and
                  unhappy consequences. But if they were often short on mercy, they seldom failed in
                  justice, and rarely broke the bonds of loyalty.</p>
               <p>After the fall of the Norse Republic and the rise of the medieval
                  church, which, in Iceland as elsewhere in those god-bitten days, arrogated unto
                  itself powers and principalities that formerly rested with the nobles, many an
                  ancient house was brought to ruin, and only those individuals who, in the course
                  of time, managed to slide into the pontifical service rose once more to public
                  place. That, I suppose, rather than piety or special virtue, accounts for the
                  priests and prelates that distinguished my mother’s family. However dire the
                  economic fortunes of the country, some one of the line always managed to pop up in
                  ministerial robes, and their daughters, as a matter of course, were predestined to
                  the high service of husbands similarly placed. But the same quality which on the
                  one hand upheld the old traditions without flinching might, on the other, pursue a
                  tangent, and meet with grief.</p>
               <p>My poor great-great-grandmother was a case in point. She was a
                  pretty woman, the youngest of several sisters, all of whom, in due course, snared
                  her minister, and, according to the tale, were a credit to the family. They were
                  forceful, vigorous, wilful women, who knew, without a shadow of doubt what was
                  right, not only for themselves, but for their youngest sister, whom they dearly
                  loved, but secretly suspected of a doubtful gentleness. They had seen her, on
                  several occasions, listening with too rapt attention to the silly verses of a
                  handsome young nobody from a neighbouring farm. Being their sister, they could not
                  of course, accuse her of indiscretion, even in thought. The most they could do was
                  set her at weaving whenever the young man came to discuss the law and the prophets
                  with papa. And, to prevent her mind from wandering, one or another dear sister
                  would read her something really inspiring from the Latin-threaded tomes of the
                  bishops’ archives.</p>
               <p>Yet, the unthinkable befell. One morning the sisters gathered in
                  the badstoffa, their faces drawn and white, their glances
                  veiled under shamed lashes. Their breakfast coffee drunk, the eldest, lifting her
                  burning eyes, broke the dreadful silence, voicing what must be said.</p>
               <p>‘Margot has gone,’ she said. ‘Gone—you understand? There are to be
                  no inquiries. No explanations. When affliction strikes a house, it must be borne
                  in silence. The Lord gives and the Lord taketh away. . . .’</p>
               <p>That was the end of the matter. So they thought. But they had
                  reckoned without that other nagging virtue, loyalty. Margot was officially dead,
                  but her memory burned in their hearts. They never spoke of her, yet each knew
                  when, by some roundabout means, word reached one or another, and a sort of gloom
                  would hang over the house for days. It did not surprise them that poor Margot’s
                  happiness was short-lived, or that the shock of disillusionment and the break with
                  her family was undermining her health. That was the natural consequence of an
                  unnatural act. Margot had wilfully betrayed the laws of common sense. She had
                  thought that romantic love could cancel the incompatibilities inherent in such a
                  misalliance as hers. She had thought that her husband’s flare for poesy would
                  stand between her and the harsh realities of a poverty-stricken life.</p>
               <p>No, the sisters were not the least surprised that Margot went about
                  her humble duties like a wistful ghost, seldom speaking, and never heard to laugh.
                  But that was a year of bad harvests and fearful weather, and often, after the
                  winter had closed in upon them, the sisters would stop in the midst of their
                  labours, and their thoughts, though unspoken, were plain to all. How was Margot
                  faring in that wretched place? Had she even the common necessities of
                  life. . . .</p>
               <p>It was spring when the news reached them. Margot was dying of
                  consumption. She had borne a child, and the doctor suspected she had had such a
                  bad time of it because she was under-nourished. The dreadful tidings were brought
                  by Jon himself. To his personal misery the sisters were blind and deaf. That the
                  poor young man was half dead with grief, and was come to beg their help humbly for
                  Margot, apparently touched them not at all. Margot had no hand in his coming, he
                  said—but she was dying.</p>
               <p>The sisters held a council. Margot must come home—they must send
                  for her at once—but she must come as she had left, unencumbered, alone. One look
                  at their cold, hard faces, and whatever plea the poor husband may have had in mind
                  for his helpless infant died unspoken. Perhaps he understood them better than they
                  knew. They were just without mercy, utterly incapable of comprehending the graces
                  of a truly charitable mind. They would be good to Margot. They would welcome her
                  without recrimination, since that was the only procedure that could wipe from
                  their minds the ghastly nightmare of her wilful behaviour.</p>
               <p>So the prodigal came home to die in the bosom of a solicitous
                  family, to whom, however, she dared say nothing of the little one left in the
                  desolate crofter’s hut. But, when she was dead, the sisters had the child put to
                  foster with a highly respectable family. They would have none of it themselves,
                  for that would remind them of too many bitter memories. Still, the child had its
                  rights—it must not grow up in ignorance, condemned to the stupid existence of an
                  utterly commonplace person.</p>
               <p>That disowned, not quite commonplace person, was my
                  great-grandmother, and, from all accounts, her plebeian contribution had little
                  effect on the sterner qualities peculiar to the family on which she was so
                  haplessly grafted. But in that I may be wrong. Certainly, in the eyes of her
                  people, mother repeated that wretched mistake when she married my father.</p>
               <p>It was a wild, windy day that blew an arctic chill from the
                  mountains when father first rode into the wide courtyard before the ancient
                  deanery, seeking shelter. Mother was a little girl of ten, with a small delicate
                  face and great ropes of bronze-coloured hair dangling down her back. She had been
                  sent to the church, which stood at a little distance from the house, to fetch a
                  hymnal for the dean, who was preparing the house-service for his people. It was
                  she who first sighted the young men riding down from the hills, singing at the
                  tops of their lungs, and making a gay spectacle in their riding-clothes and finely
                  appointed accoutrements. The little horses stepped to the wind and sailed, heads
                  high, tails streaming behind them, into the ancient courtyard.</p>
               <p>Their coming must have created an uncomfortable stir, and, no
                  doubt, a consequent pleasurable excitement. For the dean was famous for his zeal
                  in the church, whereas, at least one of the young gallants, my future father, was
                  infamous for his heretical intellectualism, and was a divorced man besides!</p>
               <p>From all reports of father at that time, he was a dashing young
                  man, too handsome for his own good, and possessed of a pleasant, persuasive voice.
                  He was gay and witty, a radical in thought, and, like so many young men of his
                  generation, given to pleasure and the glass that cheers. He was the son of a
                  landed farmer, whose patch of precious earth, nestling under the dark shadow of
                  mountains, was a source of deep affection. It was historic ground. Scarcely a foot
                  of it but was consecrated by some event in ancient story. It was truly the land of
                  their fathers, romantically loved and dearly treasured. How deeply loved can be
                  judged by the fact that, a generation after it had passed from the family, my aunt
                  in Winnipeg commissioned an artist to paint the homestead that so much of it at
                  least might be preserved to its spiritual children.</p>
               <p>They called it Ferry-Cot, and even in its painted semblance it
                  looks a jolly place, as though something of its former rash hospitality lingered
                  through the years. The beautiful White River winds lazily by, skirting the
                  haylands, and the vagrant roads drop down from the mountain flanks—river and roads
                  that brought so many ever-welcome visitors to the friendly old house. It is a
                  sturdy house, as befits a dwelling where turbulent spirits worked out their
                  turbulent destiny. It has the look of having weathered many storms, and settled at
                  long last to sadly sweet dreams.</p>
               <p>Those who are kindly inclined say that grandfather’s mismanagement
                  of Ferry-Cot dated from the death of his first wife, Fru Anna, a woman of
                  refinement and charm, and a singer of considerable merit. She had a way with her,
                  say the old folk, a gentle persuasion that kept her impetuous husband from many a
                  folly. She smiled upon his blustering, smoothing away irritation, and, without
                  seeming so to do, really steered the domestic craft. When she died grandfather
                  thought the world had come to an end. His grief was genuine and tragic—his choice
                  of solace, no doubt, inexcusably weak and unwise. He was seldom sober, though
                  never drunk, and took to riding about the country with his cronies, leaving the
                  management of his land to servants. He could not bear the chill loneliness of that
                  motherless house, and the sight of his bereaved children only increased his
                  misery. He was sorry for them, but sorrier for himself. ‘I had the fairest woman
                  to wife,’ he is quoted as saying, ‘and I had not the sense to appreciate her.’</p>
               <p>It is difficult in this day and age, to give any adequate picture
                  of what an old-fashioned Iceland farm was like, or to define the peculiar position
                  of servants in such a patriarchal institution. But nothing is further from my mind
                  than to create an impression of wealth in regard to grandfather’s humble, though
                  comfortable, estate. That there were many working folk (vinnu
                     folk) on the place was so from necessity, not because of affluence or
                  vanity. In those days a farm was a miniature manufacturing plant, a self-contained
                  institution. Almost everything needed and used in the home was made there. It was
                  not merely a question of raising sheep and cattle and laying in the supplies of
                  fodder necessary to their keep. Hides were tanned for shoes, the wool transformed
                  into yarn for spinning and weaving, and this in turn meant that men and women
                  proficient in such crafts must be employed, either by the season or permanently,
                  as was more often the case on a large estate.</p>
               <p>Horses were the only means of transportation, and there was always
                  a large number trained, either for riding, which meant breaking them to pacing,
                  since no Icelander would ride a horse that trotted, or for work as pack ponies.
                  Every farm had, therefore, its smithy and in the smith a man who understood and
                  loved horses. The cattle and sheep required herdsman and shepherd, and since sheep
                  are milked in Iceland, a number of milkmaids, who had charge of the buttery and
                  cheese-making. Meats were cured, fish dried and salted, huge kegs of skir prepared
                  for the winter. An Icelandic bur was something to delight a
                  woman’s heart, its shelves lined with cheeses, piles of flaky flatbread, firkins
                  of butter, the rafters hung with sweet-smelling smoked mutton, and on the floor
                  huge tubs and barrels of pickled meats, pressed sheep’s heads, spiced rolls of
                  flank lamb, and bales of dried fish. The making of these edibles was entirely in
                  the hands of women, as was the yearly supply of soap, and the thousands of candles
                  required through the long winter.</p>
               <p>Tailoring of both men’s and women’s wear was carried on in the
                  home, and, of course, in that pre-machine age it was done by hand. Yet I have
                  never seen a more neatly turned lapel than one shown me by an old woman trained in
                  those ancient days, and the work of her patient fingers.</p>
               <p>All manner of handicrafts were expertly done on such farms;
                  needlework of various sorts, the most beautiful of which was the baldering—gold and silver embroidery used on festal garments—an art
                  perfected by Viking women; delicate crochet, weaving, knitting, the making of
                  dyes, and, on the men’s part, carving in wood and bone, cabinet-making,
                  bookbinding, leather work of many kinds, and, most respected of useful arts, the
                  copying of ancient manuscripts. Indeed, many a rough-looking chap, who spent his
                  days pitching hay and tending cattle, might of an evening, and by no better light
                  than a tallow candle, turn out an illuminated page in script as fine as copper
                  type, his capitals a work of sheer art, delicately shaded in blues and gold and
                  scarlet.</p>
               <p>It is perhaps not so difficult to imagine that so many people,
                  living under one roof-tree, each contributing something toward the general
                  welfare, should retain a self-respect and an independence not to be found among
                  our servants of modern employers. There was never any stigma attached to labour in
                  Iceland, and yet no people were ever more conscious of race. Individual integrity
                  and attainments—which were expected of well-born people—these were the criteria,
                  and no amount of money could supply the deficiency.</p>
               <p>Grandfather may well have been as unwise in his selection of
                  workers as he was in his choice of companions. At any rate he awoke, one day, to
                  the disagreeable fact that his affairs were badly handled. When Fru Anna was at
                  the helm everything had run smoothly enough. The solution, therefore, was another
                  wife. He found her in a widow with a son about the same age as my father. From all
                  reports, she was a sensible, amiable woman, who accepted the proposal in good
                  grace. Amiable she proved, indeed, but anything but a manager. As the hasty wooer
                  soon discovered, the new Frua was indolent and much too fond of physical comfort
                  to inaugurate any vigorous improvements. She was a stout, cheery soul, who firmly
                  believed in the road of least resistance. She was careless and untidy, and often
                  drove grandfather into tantrums by leaving her personal ornaments strewn about the
                  buttery.</p>
               <p>‘Well, well, who is to steal them, my dear?’ she would laugh. ‘If
                  they aren’t safe in the buttery, they won’t be safe in the bedroom.’</p>
               <p>Some of these heirlooms, which once graced a butter tub, are now in
                  the national museum. Quaint old pieces of silver filigree, fine as lace, and
                  dating back no one knows how many generations.</p>
               <p>But Frua had her loving attributes. She was a kind step-mother. She
                  was as kind to my father as to her own son and the little daughter she bore to
                  grandfather. Father’s elder sisters seldom spoke of her. Perhaps they resented
                  that a woman so different from their beloved mother had taken her place. Being
                  women, they doubtless were more critical of niceties and more apt to be
                  antagonistic. Father always thought of her with sincere affection, and loved to
                  recount how mischievously he and her own son behaved toward the poor lady.</p>
               <p>She grew heavy with the years, and consequently, more devoted to
                  comfort. She was, too, I gathered, not above believing in the Hidden People. When
                  she was busy in the bur the boys thought it rare sport to
                  terrify the good soul with moans and groans and mysterious noises. Then the fun
                  began: having drawn a shriek, the young imps pounced out, hooting their glee, and
                  Frua, flying into a temper, would seize a ladle or a whisk, and chase her
                  tormentors, crying: ‘Impish little worms! Wait till I lay hold of you!’ The chase
                  generally extended round the house, till, breath and bulk exhausted, Frua gave up
                  and laughingly told the little worms to behave themselves.</p>
               <p>‘You should have a hiding, so you should, skratans
                     ormarnir! But look, now—if you behave, you can have a cookie!’</p>
               <p>A kind, generous-hearted woman, her indifferent management was not,
                  as grandfather discovered, likely to save the household from disaster. Year
                  followed year, and, instead of improvement, it now became apparent that something
                  drastic must be done if the farm was not to pass from their hands. The solution
                  grandfather hit upon this time may sound like a fantastic invention, but it must
                  be remembered that over sixty years ago a father was something more than an
                  apology for being.</p>
               <p>At any rate, grandfather needed money, and suddenly he remembered
                  that a friend of his, though blessed with means, was burdened with a plain
                  daughter. A colourless, insignificant miss, who could never make a likely match,
                  except at some sacrifice to her papa. Well then, let the wench pay off the debts
                  on Ferry-Cot with her dowry! She must marry his son.</p>
               <p>This heaven-sent inspiration in mind, grandfather straightway rode
                  off to share the happy thought with his crony. The scheme had much to commend it,
                  thought his friend, but what of the prospective bridal pair? Were they not too
                  young to know their own minds, he wondered.</p>
               <p>‘Ha! I could wish them younger still,’ said grandfather. ‘Something
                  tells me they will be hard enough to manage as it is.’</p>
               <p>Which certainly proved true. The girl wept and pleaded. My father
                  argued and stormed. They did not want to be married. They had no interest in each
                  other, nor anything in common. They fought a good fight to no purpose. Grandfather
                  meant to save the farm, and the bride’s papa to see that no daughter of his passed
                  up an opportunity to better herself. What either of them thought now, in their
                  foolish immaturity, did not matter, said the fathers. They had their duty to
                  face—their Christian, filial duty to perform.</p>
               <p>In desperation the two young things met at a secret rendezvous.
                  They were pale as death, outraged in their innermost feelings, and miserably
                  conscious of their utter helplessness. The unhappy youth apologized for the bitter
                  things he had said of his proposed bride. He had not been thinking of the tearful
                  girl before him.</p>
               <p>‘Oh, I know, I know,’ the poor girl sobbed. ‘You can’t like people
                  just because you are told to—I guess I’m kind of plain, and—and papa thinks nobody
                  will have me, except—well, like this. But he’s wrong! I—I don’t know how to tell
                  you, without seeming to be foolish——’</p>
               <p>‘Don’t tell me!’ the young man cried. ‘It’s bad enough as it is.
                  What a country! What a blind, belly-ridden country! If those old men thought of
                  anything except their damned sheep and cattle—but they don’t. They think of
                  everything in terms of chattel, even their flesh and blood, and that’s what we are
                  until we come of age.’</p>
               <p>‘Yes, that’s what we are,’ the girl echoed, brightening a little,
                  because she sensed a touch of sympathy in the firebrand before her, although his
                  eyes flashed and his coal-black hair, gleaming in the moonlight, gave him a cold,
                  tragic air. ‘I thought of running away, but where could I go? Wherever I went, I’d
                  be returned to my father’s house. I guess there is nothing we can do,
                  except—except try not to hate each other too much.’</p>
               <p>‘Oh, but you are wrong,’ he told her, with bitter intensity. ‘That
                  is exactly what we must do. Hate each other. Hate each other so effectively that
                  this sort of thing will end. What if they brand us with that Christian ceremony,
                  like they brand their sheep? Does that mean we have to live together? Look here,
                  don’t worry about me. I’ll find a way to keep out of the way. And when I’m of
                  age——’ He drew a deep breath, and the look on his face brought a lump to her
                  throat.</p>
               <p>Oh, poor boy, she thought, he is just as badly hurt as I.</p>
               <p>‘When that time comes, and it is not so long,’ he concluded
                  vehemently, ‘you shall see how well I’ll carry out the good work our dear fathers
                  began. But I’ll go to the devil in my own sweet way!’</p>
               <p>Father was not the kind of man who details, out of vanity, or for
                  idle pleasure, his amatory history. This tragic episode, which undoubtedly
                  coloured his whole existence and bore much bitter fruit, was told me by an older
                  member of the family when I myself was a woman grown, and all the painful memories
                  were gentled over by the years.</p>
               <p>It is said that those two young people faced the churchly prelate,
                  who pronounced upon them an eternal obligation, with frozen, ghostly calm, tears
                  in their desperate eyes, and who can say what hate in their hearts? The subsequent
                  fate of the little bride has no part in this story, but much that was reckless and
                  paradoxical in my father’s conduct thereafter may be attributed to this
                  unfortunate circumstance.</p>
               <p>In accordance with the times, and the means of a small landowner,
                  father acquired considerable learning at home. He was a scholar at heart,
                  passionately devoted to the sagas, and well grounded in the antiquities. He was
                  always a romanticist, demanding something more than dull, realistic details of
                  obvious faults and incidents in poetry or prose. He loved Robert Burns because of
                  his tenderness and pity, and understood that except for his weaknesses he could
                  not have reacted so surely to the sufferings of men. He used to say that there was
                  no uniform perfection in anything but mediocrity—‘and from that may the good gods
                  save us!’ He was devoted to letters and the language, and whatever he wrote was
                  carefully and conscientiously composed. Not that he had any desire to pose as a
                  stylist, but because he held that a thing worth saying at all was worth saying
                  well. He was, moreover, an original, fearless thinker, not the least affected by
                  conventional thunders or pious bigotry. Curiously enough, he was abetted in his
                  heretical rationalism by a young cleric, the Reverend Oddur, who was his tutor for
                  a season, and a lifelong friend thereafter. This young man had been educated in
                  Copenhagen, and while there had hobnobbed with the rising intellectuals, who, in
                  due course, were to cause such scandals in their respective countries, denouncing
                  tyrants and disputing the Trinity. Perverse individualists, who refused to believe
                  that man is a miserable worm, conceived in sin and shapen in iniquity. Mad
                  hatters, who even went so far as to contend that women might be trusted not to
                  wreck the earth if, now and again, they were permitted to toy with a vision that
                  transcended the cradle and the kitchen.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt but that, had grandfather not followed his
                  heavenly inspiration with regard to his son, my father would have settled down to
                  the pleasant life of an Icelandic farmer, spending his time in debating the pros
                  and cons of advancing thought and current poetry, and of the hated Danish
                  suppression. The monotonous details of farming would have fallen to others, while
                  he himself tinkered about as fancy dictated, devoting what time he pleased to his
                  own chosen craft or chosen hobby. In my father’s case it was saddlery. He was an
                  expert craftsman, and derived as much satisfaction from a meticulously executed
                  pattern, the leather handsomely tooled and the cloth fittingly embroidered, as
                  from a pointed discussion on the latest theological schism.</p>
               <p>In old Iceland the hand and the head were never at enmity, nor was
                  any man condemned to ignorance and the company of clods because he earned his
                  bread by some humble employment. Some of our greatest poets were poverty-stricken
                  farmers, and even a bishop might on occasion join in the haymaking in the short
                  summer season. It is not surprising, therefore, that when my father decided to
                  come to Canada he should think of his skill as something on which he might rely to
                  provide a decent living for himself and his children. It would have been
                  surprising had he even dreamed that a good craftsman, despite a very decent
                  education, could so effectively be reduced to the status and the misery of a slave
                  in the glorious country that ballyhooed its magnificent opportunities by way of
                  press and prophet.</p>
               <p>But that was yet to come. Father had no thought of America in his
                  youth, and, from all reports, led a hectic, erratic career after that hapless
                  marriage ceremony. It was dreadful, said the grundys, how he neglected his poor
                  young wife and flashed about the country with his godless companions. It really
                  seemed as though any pretty baggage with inviting eyes was more interesting to the
                  wayward husband than his lawful spouse. Which was doubtless quite true. But all
                  these excursions abroad were not quite so iniquitous as the good folk honestly
                  believed. There were times when father went to some isolated mountain farmstead
                  and behaved himself with decided decorum.</p>
               <p>In fact, he spent happy months teaching the children the
                  time-honoured reading, writing, arithmetic, and what he pleased of history and
                  literature. How agreeably he lent himself to the task may be gathered from the
                  fact that more than fifty years later father received a touching letter from an
                  obscure old woman who had been his pupil. Style and handwriting were so
                  ridiculously imitative of father’s that our first impulse was to laugh—but we did
                  not laugh. She was a widow now, she wrote, and life had never been easy on the
                  farm. But her children had all bettered themselves, had pursued ‘the happy path of
                  knowledge’. That was what she wanted papa to know, for it would please him.
                  Herself, she had not been able to make much of his instruction, but she had not
                  forgotten him, nor the hope he had set before her. And she signed the letter:
                  ‘Your loving little Stina’.</p>
               <p>There was a film of tears in father’s eyes as he gazed at that
                  signature a moment, trying to recall what those devoted lines wished him to
                  remember: a little girl with flying yellow hair and eager, inquisitive glances.
                  Yet, when he spoke, the familiar satiric humour sang in his voice.</p>
               <p>‘Oh, yes, my little Stina was a winsome lass, with no head for
                  figures, God bless her—but what a gaunt old warhorse she had for a mother!’</p>
               <p>These tutoring days were a pleasant interlude that left its homely
                  memories, but the restlessness and inner revolt tormenting him seem to have
                  rendered every place quickly distasteful, and all quiet occupation intolerable. He
                  must turn to something else, go on and on, seeking he knew not what, but fully
                  determined to repudiate the ties and obligations imposed upon him by paternal
                  authority.</p>
               <p>There are varying and contradictory tales of those aimless years,
                  the common denominator of which seems to be that some overpowering impulse of
                  curiosity drove him from one extreme to another. His most industrious moments were
                  tormented by doubts of futility, his wildest excesses overcast by vague regrets.
                  It might be that in his wandering, in his eager yearning, he had somewhere
                  glimpsed those fateful fairy lights that the Norsemen called Vafurlogar. Strange, unpredictable hungers seized the spirit that looked
                  upon this light; and none could tell to what quest it bound one, whether after
                  riches, or beauty, or some dimly guessed knowledge beyond the stars. There was
                  only one thing certain: once those silver torches had fired the fringe of
                  consciousness, only death ended the searching wanderlust of the soul.</p>
               <p>It is true, at all events, that nothing so plagued my father as the
                  smug monotony most people mistake for spiritual grace and happiness. In common
                  with his godless companions, he subscribed to the tolerant doctrines of
                  liberalism, and doubtless drained too many tankards to the glory of the newly
                  liberated spirit of man. Also, like those other hotheads who punned against a
                  graft-ridden government and thumbed noses at its pious beneficiaries, he is said
                  to have serenaded too many susceptible damsels by the melting light of the
                  midnight sun.</p>
               <p>There were other deeds of which less was said—impulsive, kindly
                  deeds. There was the time a poor, filthy beggar died in his hut on the outskirts
                  of a hamlet where father happened to be. The sheriff could find no one willing to
                  prepare the wretched creature for decent burial. Alive, he had been a disgrace,
                  scarcely tolerated in the cowsheds. Let him lie to the last judgement in the state
                  he had chosen!</p>
               <p>‘But he must once have thought like a man—dreamed like a man,’
                  cried my father. ‘Who can say where the blame rests? In him, or another, that he
                  lost that dream.’</p>
               <p>‘Fine words, fine words!’ muttered the sheriff, glowering at the
                  fastidious romanticist. ‘You wouldn’t mind the dirty task yourself, I
                  suppose—you’d fair jump at it, now wouldn’t you!’</p>
               <p>‘I will do it very gladly,’ said my father.</p>

               <p>Other similarly distasteful things father performed when he thought
                  they should be done to justify man’s existence and set him on a plane above the
                  beast. Trivial gestures, no doubt, born of a vagrant idealistic moment, yet as
                  irrepressible and impellent as the adventurous streak that nothing ever quite
                  destroyed. The new, the strange, the unknown, these never lost their fascination
                  for my father, however cramping his circumstances might be.</p>
               <p>It was adventure more than anything that sent him, as a young man,
                  to the north of Iceland to serve as a coast-guard. Patrolling those wild,
                  hazardous waters was always an unpredictable venture. The rockbound coast with its
                  whipping gales and gloomy fogs and churning sea wore a perpetual air of evil doom,
                  as though some god of the deep, resenting the greedy persistence of the warring
                  fishing fleets, had vowed everlasting destruction. Of all the famous northern
                  preserves none was more feared than this, and never a season passed without its
                  bitter toll of human lives, and sturdy schooners ground to matchwood. It was the
                  duty of the coast patrol to salvage such wreckage, and whatever else tragic or
                  treasurable the sea might yield.</p>
               <p>It was here after a storm of unusual fury that father had a curious
                  experience which, since he was neither superstitious nor religious in the narrow,
                  conventional sense, may bear retelling. The storm had lasted for days, beating up
                  from intermittent squalls to a raging tempest. A Brittany fishing schooner had
                  fought the waters within sight of shore, and, despite every effort of the patrol
                  to come to her assistance, was crushed like an eggshell by the savage waters. The
                  first lull in the storm came at dawn, and all that day the exhausted patrol
                  searched for the dead among the numerous skerries and jagged rocks that
                  characterized the treacherous coastline. By the time the early dusk terminated the
                  dreary task, many poor, broken bodies had been brought to the little chapel,
                  which, chained to the rocks, sounded a note of sublime challenge to the angry sea.
                  Their immediate duty done, father and his two companions, almost dropping in their
                  tracks, stumbled on to their quarters in the barren house of an old woman, long
                  since widowed by these same waters.</p>
               <p>They wanted nothing but sleep, uninterrupted, healing sleep. Yet,
                  in less than three hours, father was rudely jolted back to consciousness. His
                  first reaction was sheer rage. Who the devil had dared wake him? Raising himself
                  on an elbow, he peered through the gloom, and thought he saw a figure in the
                  doorway. But, though he called out in vitriolic tones, no one answered, and, as
                  his heavy eyes cleared, he perceived that, except for his sleeping companions, the
                  room was empty and still. He must have been dreaming, he thought, and, grumbling
                  at his own foolishness, he drove back into the pillows and was instantly fast
                  asleep. Not for long, however. This time it was not a sound that broke his rest,
                  but the weird sensation of being shaken. Nor was there any mistaking what he saw.
                  Three figures, clearly distinguished, yet oddly wavering, as though he were seeing
                  them through swirls of fog, stood at his bedside. They stood there in the grey
                  gloom, transfixing him with sombre eyes, their lips moving soundlessly. ‘By
                  heaven, now I am dreaming!’ father exclaimed, and jumped to hear his own voice
                  ringing through the quiet room.</p>
               <p>‘Kver fjandin!’ His bedfellow started up crossly. ‘Why the
                  shouting—have you gone crazy?’</p>
               <p>‘Perhaps I have, Nonni,’ father answered sheepishly. ‘Something
                  like it. Thought I was seeing things.’</p>
               <p>‘Hell!’ Nonni yanked the blankets over his head. ‘See away, but for
                  the Lord’s sake shut up!’</p>
               <p>That ended the queer disturbance, and the young men slept until
                  late in the morning, when their kind old housekeeper brought a tray with steaming
                  coffee and flat bread.</p>
               <p>‘Praise God you’ve had your rest, I see,’ she greeted them
                  mournfully. ‘Not but what you needed it, poor lads.’</p>
               <p>‘Now, don’t tell us you had the toothache again,’ Nonni
                  sympathized, but father seemed to know what she wanted to say, and frowned at the
                  thought.</p>
               <p>‘No, not the toothache—a body could stand that better. Nightmare,
                  that’s what it was. Me that’s used to the sea all my life dreaming three
                  foreigners dripping brine and looking sad as the last judgement. Queer, I call it,
                  and no good omen.’</p>
               <p>‘Poor old girl,’ Nonni muttered, when she had shuffled out. ‘Those
                  beastly sights are getting too much for her.’</p>
               <p>‘Suppose it wasn’t a nightmare!’ father said. ‘Suppose I should
                  tell you I saw the three myself?’</p>
               <p>‘Bosh! Imagination. That’s your ailment, Lars.’</p>
               <p>Perhaps. But father decided to comb the beach once more. Dream or a
                  dead man’s desire to communicate by some power of the mind not yet
                  understood—whichever it was, there might be some reason for it. And reason there
                  seemed to be, for that morning father found the three bodies almost buried in a
                  sandbar a mile or so up the shore. The outgoing tide would have swept them down to
                  an unmarked grave. That, mayhap, was what they feared. There was nothing by way of
                  identification on the bodies, but all three wore scapularies eloquent of their
                  religious faith. There was no Catholic priest in the vicinity, but father had them
                  buried in the tiny churchyard, a white cross marking the lonely resting-place.</p>
               <p>It was after a sojourn in the north that father once again broke a
                  long, wearisome ride at the Deanery. He had no memory of the little girl who,
                  seven years before, announced his first visit and listened to his gay narratives
                  in shy fascination. But I think she did, and that flattering hint of memory must
                  have added to her charm. She was a dainty little person, barely five feet tall,
                  with marvellous hair, a flawless complexion, and humorous eyes. And she had the
                  fascinating manner of a very young girl playing at decorum while her thoughts
                  danced in a saraband of secret fun.</p>
               <p>They seem to have been fated to meet at a most impressionable
                  moment. To the man who had followed a dozen whims in the effort to forget a
                  disagreeable interlude, she was a delightful, irresistible discovery. To her, he
                  was the reincarnation of a dream—the poor young man with whom she had sympathized
                  so deeply on that former visit. Persecution had crowned him with peculiar charm.
                  And here he was, whimsical as ever, and with the added attraction of a reputation
                  that set people bickering for and against him. He was charming, yes, but
                  irresponsible. His beguiling manner was apt to make one forget that he had abjured
                  the staid conventions and even repudiated sacred dogma! He was a pleasant
                  companion, but not the sort of man an innocent girl should marry!</p>
               <p>Sensible argument, however, as usual, was quite unavailing. That
                  fateful streak of stubbornness, characteristic of the breed, sharpened under
                  pressure into an unshakable devotion. Every one was against him, so, of course,
                  she loved him. In less than a year, they were married—if you could call it
                  marriage when a man had another wife living, and only the law to sanction his
                  behaviour!</p>
               <p>Her people were never reconciled to the match. They could foresee
                  only misery and unhappiness in the mating of individuals so utterly different in
                  taste and training. Nevertheless, being what they were, she received a generous
                  dowry. Father had rented a small farm, but the stock, sheep, household linen, and
                  even mother’s riding horse, were the gifts of the dean.</p>
               <p>They should have prospered. But ten years of haphazard living
                  dedicated to the quest of some rare adventure had unfitted father for a sudden
                  plunge into fleckless domesticity. Moreover, it was soon apparent that those two,
                  who had chosen each other for better or worse, despite bitter opposition, were
                  emotionally unsuited, and apt to clash on any number of inconsequential, yet
                  provocative opinions. Temperamentally, they were poles apart. He was impetuous,
                  warm-hearted, and, like every romanticist, superficial in his emotions: quick to
                  forget both pleasure and pain. On the other hand, she was deeply reserved,
                  somewhat cold in deportment, and, although far too sensible for neurotic brooding,
                  seldom forgot either an injury or a kindness. Father, whose feelings were coloured
                  by the passing moment, found it easy to express himself; whereas mother, whose
                  sentiments were fixed, was always helplessly inarticulate where her innermost
                  sensibilities were concerned. She had the keenest wit, in latter years often
                  devastatingly caustic, but in those early years of growing disillusionment I think
                  she must have suffered mental agonies for which she found no words, and pride
                  drove deeper and deeper into her heart.</p>
               <p>From the very beginning everything went amiss. It seems that father
                  either could not, or would not, shake off his former companions. They descended in
                  droves upon the little household, and, however ably they may have settled the
                  seething political questions of the hour, they contributed nothing towards the
                  stability of the farm. The hay might be blowing away in a windstorm, and a dozen
                  sheep need shearing, but a girl-wife could hardly interpolate such commonplaces
                  into floods of glowing eloquence, both patriotic and transcendental! Nor was there
                  any use attempting to stay the crusading company when the spirit moved them to
                  spread their liberal gospel far and wide. Like grandfather before him, father
                  evidently expected the farm to prosper without much help from himself.</p>
               <p>That he should have expected an inexperienced girl of eighteen to
                  shoulder all responsibility is scarcely flattering to his judgement, and yet it
                  seems that she might have managed rather well if she had not faced more trying
                  obstacles. To begin with, those trips about the country were costly in more ways
                  than one—and, of course, debts incurred by gentlemen were ‘debts of honour’, which
                  must be paid, whatever the state of the family budget. Many a fat ewe was laid on
                  the altar of this delicate honour. And, finally, in addition to financial problems
                  and the hundred and one mishaps incidental to farming, the young wife had her own
                  predestined handicap to contend with. Before her nineteenth year she had nearly
                  lost her life in one of those brutal struggles which even yet are calmly accepted
                  as the divinely ordained lot of women. After three days of unspeakable agonies the
                  blessed reward was twins—still-born—and a fuller realization of the handicap of
                  her sex.</p>
               <p>Few sentimentalists measure up to their fine phrases in a
                  distressing crisis. Father seems to have evaded the disagreeable by protracted
                  jaunts over the country. I have a suspicion that he received sympathy with fine
                  grace on these occasions, and responded with charming delicacy. None of which was
                  much comfort for his wife, left alone to face disillusionment and increasing
                  financial worries.</p>
               <p>The next few years were anything but enheartening. If father had
                  any talent for farming, he failed to show it. Any bargain he drove was sure to
                  prove disastrous, and one time, in a fit of jollity, he gambled away the better
                  part of the flock of sheep which was their mainstay. Well, one had to lose
                  sometime, he reasoned cheerfully. To-morrow would be different. But to-morrow was
                  never different. For some reason he simply could not settle down to the sober
                  monotony of serious existence. That so many people had hungrily fixed on every
                  caprice from the beginning, and predicted inevitable failure, may have had much to
                  do with it. And I sometimes think that a weaker woman might have managed better
                  than my mother. Like many another strong character, she made the mistake of
                  assuming with embittered patience more and more responsibility. A little guileful
                  flattery and coy appeal to the ever-susceptible gallant in father might have
                  brought astonishing results. If she only could have understood that the poetic
                  temperament requires the camouflage of romanticism to render even the most obvious
                  duties palatable, life might have been less barren for both of them. But that was
                  too much to expect of a young woman, forthright rather than analytical by nature,
                  who, nurtured as she was in the sterner principles, now found herself plunged into
                  an existence that taxed all her strength and ability. Theories and speculations
                  were all very fine—she had listened to them spellbound those first few months of
                  married life—but they did not pay land dues, or add one krona to the budget.</p>
               <p>With determination and tireless energy she kept the little
                  establishment off the rocks, working from dawn till dark, whatever the state of
                  her health, her only vacations those enforced rest periods when another blessed
                  event called a halt to the never-ending work at hand. Father, meanwhile, continued
                  flirting with fate.</p>
               <p>It was on one of those wasteful trips through the country that he
                  met an immigration agent who was enthusiastically selling Canada to the
                  Icelanders. Marvellous reports were detailed of the immigrants in that matchless
                  country. Already most of them were on the high road to fortune.</p>
               <p>‘Think of it!’ said the gentleman. ‘Over there, any able-bodied man
                  can instantly find lucrative employment in the city, or, better still, take
                  advantage of the generous homesteading grant, which makes him the owner of a tract
                  of land of such fertility as is undreamed of in barren Iceland. As to the other
                  avenues of wealth—well!’ Here the agent laughed significantly. He really didn’t
                  dare enlarge upon the possibilities open to trappers, hunters, fishermen, and
                  freighters, for no one would believe him.</p>
               <p>Unfortunately for many, they did believe him. They believed him
                  with eagerness born of long-suffering. The country was entering upon a slow period
                  of arduous adjustment, which, to be thoroughly understood, requires more
                  explanation than seems pertinent to introduce here. However, passing mention must
                  be made of the iniquitous trade monopolies, which, operating as they did over a
                  period of three hundred and eighty years, had almost reduced the country to
                  economic slavery. It began with the Hanseatic League, to which company of German
                  merchant princes the Danish crown sold the Icelandic fishing trade for two hundred
                  and forty years. Their policy of absolute control and unabating greed rapidly
                  reduced the native fisherman to abject poverty. He could neither buy nor sell
                  through any other agency, and the slightest deflection brought swift and instant
                  punishment. Once in the bad books of a tyrannical factor, and a man never knew
                  what the day had in store. He might be blacklisted in the fishing fleet, or his
                  catch discounted as unfit for foreign shipment. Yet he dared not dispose of it on
                  home soil, nor steal a bite for himself or his children.</p>
               <p>The Hanseatic League, aided and abetted by miserable agents, left a
                  bitter memory behind it, yet its policies were angelic as compared with those of
                  the Harkraemer Syndicate, which followed and bled the country for one hundred and
                  forty years.</p>
               <p>This infamous house added secret settlement and intimidation of the
                  vilest sort to the sufficiently unsavoury practices of its predecessor. As before,
                  the prices were fixed for the Icelanders, but, whereas the Hanseatics had at least
                  maintained a pirate’s rough justice, the Harkraemer agents were adepts in
                  dishonesty. Not content to estimate every catch at the lowest possible value, they
                  resorted to crooked balances, and each succeeding season they raised the costs of
                  outfitting the fleets and the prices of commodities required by the people. For
                  instance, in 1702 a barrel of flour sold at two rigsdaler—by 1800 it had risen to
                  ten. Yet a skipspund of fish (160 kilograms), for which the
                  Icelander might have received from thirty to forty dollars in other markets, had
                  to be sold to the Danish syndicate for seven dollars. But even this did not
                  satisfy the greed of these ‘princes’. They began importing rotten food and wormy
                  flour!</p>
               <p>It is a moot question whether the Icelanders, who, first of
                  northern races, instituted a republic and a democratic parliament, could have been
                  reduced to such servile straits if nature had not alined herself with their
                  aggressors.</p>
               <p>Ravages from volcanic disturbances defy adequate description. To
                  begin with, there are 107 volcanoes in a country which is only one-fifth larger
                  than Ireland. Since historic times twenty-five vents have caused almost
                  inestimable damage, while countless others, still extant, have been fitfully
                  active. Lava streams from these various sources cover an area of 4,650 square
                  miles.</p>
               <p>Odadahraun (Lava of Evil Deeds) on the tableland of Skapta Jökull,
                  two to four thousand feet above sea-level, covers thirteen hundred square miles,
                  and represents the accretion of countless eruptions from twenty vents whose
                  activity antedates historic record. As an indication of the fearful effect of such
                  eruptions over a period of centuries I shall mention three recorded instances.</p>
               <p>On the 5th of April 1766 the southern countryside was plunged into
                  terror. From the summit of Mount Hekla a huge pillar of black sand was seen slowly
                  ascending the heavens, to the hideous accompaniment of subterranean thunders. Then
                  a coronet of flame encircled the crater, giving the mountain an unholy air of
                  satanic grandeur. The next instant, masses of red rock, pumice, and magnetic
                  stones were hurled up from the inferno in such continuous showers as to resemble a
                  swarm of bees clustering over the crater. The stones were flung to incredible
                  distances; one boulder, six feet in circumference, was pitched twenty miles,
                  another, of magnetic stone, for fifteen miles. The air was so darkened that one
                  hundred and fifty miles away it was impossible to distinguish white from black at
                  a little distance. On the 9th of April the lava began to flow, and ran for five
                  miles in a south-westerly direction, bringing death and destruction to all before
                  it.</p>
               <p>Yet this was as nothing compared with what the country had suffered
                  from former eruptions of the historic mountain, or to that which was in store for
                  the people from an unsuspected quarter. From the confines of Skapta Jökull,
                  solitary monarch of an impenetrable desert comprising four hundred square miles,
                  cradled among icefields, descended the most spectacular visitation ever known to
                  that ill-fated land. Toward the end of May 1783, following a winter and spring of
                  exceptionally fine weather, a light bluish fog began to float along the wastes of
                  Skapta, and was followed early in June by great tremors of the earth. On the
                  eighth of the month immense pillars of smoke gathered over the hill country to the
                  north, and, coming down against the wind in a southerly direction, enveloped the
                  whole district of Sida in darkness.</p>
               <p>A whirlwind of ashes swept over the country, and on the tenth
                  innumerable fire-spouts were seen leaping and flaring amid the icy hollows of the
                  mountain, while the River Skapta, one of the largest of the island, having rolled
                  down to the plain in a vast volume of fetid waters mixed with sand, suddenly
                  disappeared. Two days later a stream of lava, issuing from sources no one has been
                  able to penetrate, came sliding down the bed of the dried-up river, and, though
                  the channel was six hundred feet deep and two hundred feet wide, the glowing
                  deluge quickly overflowed its banks, crossed the fertile low country of Medalland,
                  ripping the turf up before it like a tablecloth, and poured into a great lake,
                  whose waters rose, hissing and steaming, into the air. Within a few days the basin
                  of the lake itself was filled, and the unexhausted torrent again commenced its
                  march, in one direction overflowing some ancient lava beds, and in the other
                  re-entering the channel of Skapta, and leaping down the lofty cataracts of
                  Stapafosse. Nor was this all. Another lava flood was working similar havoc on the
                  plains of Hvervis Fljot, rushing through the country with even greater velocity.
                  The historian to whom I am indebted for the above colourful, yet authentic,
                  record, goes on to estimate the losses in livestock in this one eruption. They are
                  as follows: 11,500 cattle, 2,800 horses, 190,000 sheep, which in itself represents
                  almost an Inquisitorian death sentence to a people whose economic resources were
                  so wickedly exploited. In actual figures, the ensuing famine carried off 9,500
                  human lives, and left thousands more with permanently impaired health.</p>
               <p>In this day and age we are accustomed to relief agencies that rush
                  in with help of every kind to any people similarly afflicted. It is, therefore,
                  difficult to visualize a state of conscience which left the so-called protectors
                  of the Icelanders not only indifferent to their frightful misery, but which
                  actually spurred them to further aggrandizement. Yet such is the truth. With all
                  the unction of medieval Christianity, the Harkraemer Company increased its trade
                  demands under the cloak of beneficent helpfulness. The destitute had only to sell
                  themselves, body and soul, for the privilege of keeping alive!</p>
               <p>Another vital factor enters into the sinister picture. Such violent
                  eruptions are not only destructive on land, but, through furious subterranean
                  action, affect the tides, thereby killing the spawn and driving off the shoals of
                  fish. Consequently, the one remaining livelihood of the helpless people was
                  seriously disrupted, and their unscrupulous masters given a plausible excuse for
                  further extortion.</p>
               <p>There were other sources of misery. Church and State, scarcely less
                  avaricious than the traders, had long since cunningly usurped most of the
                  productive lands. To be exact, the elected saviours of the poor now claimed over
                  two thousand tax-free estates, while the total of private holdings was no more
                  than that number, many of which were little more than strips of herbage in the
                  midst of lava wastes. But let no one imagine that mercy was shown the deluded
                  mortal who presumed to set the needs of his stomach above the royal tax, or the
                  tithes to the diocese! Such worldly consideration died with the poor laws of the
                  ancient heathen republic.</p>
               <p>The seventeenth century was by all accounts the darkest in
                  Iceland’s tragic history. It is neither strange nor remarkable, therefore, that
                  the Harkraemer Syndicate should have looked upon this fresh catastrophe as a
                  divine act predicated to their favour—that now, at last, the rebellious Norse
                  spirit must subside for ever. They were mistaken. They had forgotten, or perhaps
                  had never known, that long before a paradoxical code of ethics had been forced
                  upon the Icelanders they had been effectively converted to an imperishable belief
                  in the dignity of the human spirit. As Norsemen, they had so loved liberty that
                  rather than accede to the demands of a king whose policy of beneficent
                  dictatorship offended their ancient rights, they chose exile on a barren island at
                  the world’s end. Centuries of mishap and the corrosive sentimentality of a
                  negative faith had starved the ancient fires, but now, out of the ashes of deepest
                  despair, a thousand tongues leaped to life once more. Wherever two or three
                  gathered together, the gospel of liberty sounded. Desperate young men, defying all
                  sorts of degrading punishments—public whippings, imprisonment, exile—flashed up
                  and down the country, stirring the hearts of the people.</p>
               <p>Yet these political firebrands might have failed in their
                  monumental task if their message had not been caught up and impregnated by the
                  immortal ideology of the national poets. Without the magic of impassioned poetry
                  to fix and hold the public mind to the vision of a liberated Iceland, the inertia
                  of woeful poverty would certainly have defeated those rebel hopes.</p>
               <p>But, thanks to those inspired singers, the quickened spirit of
                  liberty was never again to be quelled, howsoever the heroic agitators might
                  suffer. Penalties and punishments were so much added fuel to the fire. Individuals
                  might be silenced and destroyed, a dozen others leaped into the breach. The fierce
                  old Viking soul had found a tongue once more to raise such a storm that, at long
                  last, even the Royal Ear was disturbed, the August Conscience troubled. As a
                  result, the Crown abolished the Harkraemer charter in 1850, thereby ending all
                  trade monopoly. That memorable date marks the beginning of an amazing struggle for
                  rehabilitation by the Icelandic people—a struggle fraught with every imaginable
                  handicap, to the complete vindication of the tenacious Viking spirit. In 1904 Home
                  Rule was established, and in 1918, Iceland became an independent nation.</p>
               <p>This sketchy reference to the historic past is not so extraneous to
                  my story as it appears. Economic pressure, and nothing else, was responsible for
                  the only group emigration of Icelanders to Canada. In 1875 occurred the last of
                  those major eruptions which I have chosen out of many to illustrate the
                  unpredictable disasters that hounded the little nation. On this occasion it was
                  Askja, a relatively insignificant volcano, that erupted, and yet such was its
                  violence that a rain of ashes fell for eleven hours and forty minutes on the west
                  coast of Norway. Fifteen hours later the city of Stockholm, Sweden, was plunged
                  into semi-darkness by the onrushing clouds.</p>
               <p>It was this fresh catastrophe that, in aftermath, so weakened the
                  resources of the people that word of their suffering reached Lord Dufferin,
                  one-time Governor-General of Canada. It was he, who, with the best of intentions,
                  first drew attention to the Icelanders as possible settlers for Canada. Lord
                  Dufferin had visited Iceland, and, as his Letters From High
                     Latitudes tend to show, had found the people interesting and admirable. It
                  was his hope that in Canada the qualities he had marked and admired might take
                  root and contribute to the cultural life of the dominion.</p>

               <head>Exile</head>
               <p>Unfortunately for us, the zeal of the immigrant agents somewhat
                  outstripped their veracity. The tales they told had less point in truth than
                  fiction. But, to my adventure-thirsting father, the glowing recital was a potent
                  inspiration and the answer to all his boredom and perplexity. Why, if even
                  one-tenth of the report were true, a man should prosper in that far dominion! And
                  how good it would be to be done with carping criticism.</p>
               <p>Mother seems to have agreed willingly enough. What had she to lose?
                  As it was, she was effectively cut off from her own people. Only once, and that
                  when the old dean lay dying, had she set foot in her home. A tragic occasion,
                  rendered the more bitter because of her obvious poverty. Even her beloved riding
                  horse had gone the way of other possessions, and she was forced to borrow a shaggy
                  mount, as well as her habit.</p>
               <p>What little remained of household effects and farm animals was sold
                  at auction—a dreary transaction which she watched from a green knoll, three small
                  children at her knees and a new-born infant in her arms.</p>
               <p>The ship that was to have borne them to Scotland did not put in at
                  Isafjordur as had been promised. Those were days of uncertain sailings between
                  Iceland and the British Isles. No one seems to have had any definite information
                  to offer as to why the vessel had not arrived, or when another might be expected.
                  Their home disposed of, father decided that his best course was to move to
                  Bolungavik, where he could enter the fishing fleet while they waited for
                  transportation. Poor mother could only pray that the miracle might happen before
                  their little money had vanished.</p>
               <p>The heavenly ear may have been dulled by too many needy pleas. At
                  any rate, when, on the 9th of June 1887 they eventually sailed for Scotland, en route to Canada, their sole resources were bedding, personal
                  effects, and four small children.</p>
               <p>The ship that had been chartered to take the immigrants across the
                  stormiest of northern seas was a disreputable tub, called the Kamoens, that creaked in every timber, and was otherwise remarkable for
                  its distinctive trade odours. It had been used to transport horses! In Glasgow
                  they were transferred to slightly better quarters aboard a so-called transatlantic
                  Allen liner. In actual fact, however, there was little to commend the latter ship,
                  except that it was larger, less dirty, and quite seaworthy.</p>
               <p>Four families, irrespective of size, were allotted to a cabin, each
                  of which was furnished with four empty bunks and a bare board table. Food for
                  children and adults alike consisted of meagre rations of beef and badly baked
                  bread. The unfamiliar, tasteless diet might have been endured without disastrous
                  effects if the cabins had not been so unconscionably overcrowded that all attempts
                  at cleanliness were defeated, and even the comfort of sleep became impossible. As
                  if to make sure that these miseries worked their utmost havoc the ship ran into
                  heavy weather, through which it battled for days, only to find when the storm
                  lifted a little, that it was far off its course and, apparently, heading into a
                  freshly rising gale. Incredible though it may seem in this day and age of
                  scientific seamanship, air patrol, and radio, the hapless ship remained lost for
                  six ill-fated weeks!</p>
               <p>The inevitable result was a violent outbreak of ship’s fever, a
                  pestilence feared and familiar in those times of wretched travel. Few, indeed, on
                  that miserable ship, escaped the disease. It was a harrowing experience for all
                  concerned, and even those who fared the best shuddered in retrospect.</p>
               <p>Mothers, too ill themselves to move from their improvised beds upon
                  the floor, saw their little ones die, and, too weak for tears, watched dry-eyed as
                  their tiny forms were shrouded in canvas for the saddest of all burials.</p>
               <p>Out of the unhappy beings that crowded their particular cabin only
                  mother kept on her feet, comforting as best she could the delirious, starving
                  children. But neither prayer nor selfless ministry were availing. As the dreadful
                  days dragged on she realized that her two youngest babies could not survive. So
                  short a while ago sweetly plump and rosy, they were pitiful skeletons, whose
                  trusting infant glances and futile pleading gestures turned her soul to ice. There
                  was only one cry left in her heart. If only God would spare her that melancholy
                  ritual at sea—somehow, the thought was intolerable.</p>
               <p>The ship had found its course, and, striking utmost speed, was
                  hurrying westward with its load of human misery. In mute despair, mother watched
                  the little ones, her faith fiercely fixed upon that one forlorn hope. But even
                  that was not to be. Three days before the ship reached land the elder child was
                  consigned to the sea, and, as they docked at Quebec, the infant died.</p>
               <p>It was a prophetic beginning—a foretaste of the high cost my
                  parents were to pay for the rights of citizenship in the new country. Indeed a
                  cruel introduction to a chosen homeland. And yet, what little kindness my mother
                  was to receive by way of comfort or welcome in this new country was experienced
                  here, in the old French port, where she was never to be known, and which she was
                  never again to see.</p>
               <p>She used to speak of it sometimes, with gentle wonder. Sitting
                  there, alone with her dead, unheeding the life around her, she had suddenly heard
                  a kind voice, and felt a gentle touch upon her shoulder. It was an old priest in
                  rusty habit who stood beside her, a little stooped and worn. Although she could
                  not understand his speech, her frozen heart melted under the kindness of his face.
                  How good it seemed, in that foreign place, to behold once more a minister of
                  comfort, whose sympathy was not a forced gesture, but the expression of natural
                  sympathy. How healing to her wound was that moment of pity. For here was a man who
                  looked upon her as a sorrowing fellow being, not as an immigrant to be stared at
                  with ill-concealed curiosity. Wakened to this kindness, she became aware that
                  other kindly folk drew near, and that their eyes were full of honest
                  commiseration. It was then that the hard ring of misery compressing her heart
                  loosened. It was then that she wept.</p>
               <p>That other dear one had been given to the sea with no better shroud
                  than a shawl and a piece of dingy canvas. But now, through the efforts of the
                  immigrant agent and the sympathetic port officials, this second child was given a
                  decent burial.</p>
               <p>‘They understood, those good people,’ she used to say. ‘The little
                  coffin was the finest—white and lovely as the little body it received.’</p>
               <p>Nearly forty years later I stood amidst a gossiping crowd on the
                  terrace of the Hotel Frontenac overlooking the beautiful harbour, but my thoughts
                  were not on what was said. I was trying to see the city through my mother’s eyes,
                  trying to relive her gratitude for that understanding generosity. I wanted to
                  forget the palatial hotel behind me, and all those other modern improvements that
                  had altered, but not quite obliterated, old Quebec. I wanted to envision and
                  recapture for my own innermost memory the ancient city fronting the grey river; to
                  feel, as she had felt, the healing inspiration of the faintly mauve Laurentian
                  hills in the background—gentle hills against the gentle blue under whose shadows
                  life had moved in softer tempo, and where God had spoken through a shabby priest
                  for the healing of an overburdened heart.</p>
               <p>There is no point in labouring the long journey from Quebec to
                  Winnipeg. The Canadian Pacific Railway had by now spanned the Ontario wilderness,
                  and, compared to the route former immigrants had been obliged to follow, the new
                  mode of travel was considered in the light of a miracle. The railway carriages
                  were, however, not much improvement upon the prairie schooner and Red River carts.
                  Wooden benches lined the box-like coaches, which were open to wind and weather, to
                  showers of wood ash and flying sparks. As the decimal miles dragged on, their
                  jolting discomfort was in some respects harder to endure than the lumbering
                  progress of the outmoded schooners had been for former settlers. They had at least
                  enjoyed a more companionable adventure. At night there were welcome bivouacs
                  beside cheery fires, where the tired traveller might stretch his aching muscles
                  and renew his spirit in hopeful conversation and aspiring dreams. But here, in the
                  close confinement of carriages that ground on and on, even the friendliest soul
                  grew taciturn, and the hardiest of mortals succumbed to a listless fatigue that
                  almost amounted to stupor.</p>
               <p>One of my father’s sisters, a graduate midwife, had come to the
                  country previously, and was now living on Younge Street, in Winnipeg. The family
                  joined her, and set up joint housekeeping as best they could. The prospects were
                  far from bright. Father was still suffering from the effects of ship’s fever. Even
                  in normal health, he was not fitted for, nor accustomed to, hard manual labour,
                  which was the only work freely available for the immigrants. It was thought,
                  however, that outdoor activity might be of real benefit, and so it was with
                  hopeful eagerness that he joined a threshing gang bound for Dakota when the
                  harvest season opened. The hope was not justified. He fell seriously ill, and,
                  after six weeks in bed, tormented by anxiety for his family, he returned to
                  Winnipeg, where he worked at odd jobs throughout the winter.</p>
               <p>My aunt was a practical, highly ambitious woman, and, although
                  happily married, had no intention of confining her life to domestic drudgery. She
                  was a born nurse, if there ever was one, and she had determined to resume that
                  profession so soon as she had acquired the language and could pass the required
                  examinations. She heartily disliked every form of housework, and yet, because she
                  wanted to learn the ways of this country, as well as its speech, she went out
                  cleaning by the day.</p>
               <p>Knowing my aunt as I do, I can imagine how the women who attempted
                  to patronize the ‘queer foreigner’ must have fared. Elizabeth of England was not
                  more certain of her divine birthright than Haldora Gudmunsdottir! Without a
                  particle of vanity, she permitted no infringement upon her self-respect, which
                  epitomized a lively individualism and an unassailable belief in her own judgement.
                  Whatever clashed with her own opinions she dismissed with cheerful urbanity, not
                  to say contempt. ‘Ridiculous person!’ she once exclaimed at a fault-finding
                  employer. ‘Fussing and fuming over a bit of dust on some worthless bric-à-brac,
                  but no thought for the pantry! For what do you think I found there? Sour beans!
                  Let me tell you, I thrust them under her stupid nose.’</p>
               <p>Mother was taking care of the house, and contributing towards the
                  budget by what she earned at knitting. She would have preferred to have followed
                  her sister-in-law’s example, but some one had to assume responsibility for the
                  children—her own two little ones and aunt’s two small boys. What worried her more
                  than anything else at the time was the lack of fresh milk. To her way of thinking,
                  a child was starved without it. When she heard that a certain farmer who was said
                  to be too mean to hire needed help was throwing gallons to his pigs, she offered
                  to do the milking. It meant a daily walk of nearly three miles over a gumbo trail,
                  which, in wet weather, became a river of slippery glue. The farmer was loud in
                  verbal gratitude for her service, but when it came to concrete recompense he
                  thought that two quarts of milk was quite sufficient. After all, he had the pigs
                  to consider.</p>
               <p>It must have been galling to think of her old home in the deanery,
                  where the meanest beggar found a welcome hospitality, as she trudged that
                  wilderness trail of an evening, with her little pail of begrudged milk. I know
                  that this, and many similar incidents, embittered her outlook and hardened her
                  into the unswerving Icelander that she remained to the day of her death. A woman
                  who rejected assimilation in any degree with a people whose sensibilities she
                  doubted, and whose culture she therefore refused to admit.</p>
               <p>At this time, however, she thought little of the incident. She was
                  young, and magnificently healthy, and with a spirit not easily depressed. The milk
                  would benefit the children, and if only the colour returned to their cheeks the
                  task was worth it. Indeed, as the weeks passed they took heart. The crisp autumn
                  weather, with its brilliant sunshine, inspired cheerfulness, and the pastel beauty
                  of the turning leaves made the landscape a vibrant poem.</p>
               <p>The people might not be friendly, nor the tale of ready opportunity
                  more than a myth, but the land itself was cast in a titanic mould, and one day
                  must surely inspire greatness in its children. When the sun flamed red along the
                  limitless horizon, and the winds swept down from untrammelled wastes, it was
                  impossible not to believe that unseen forces brooded over its destiny. Avarice and
                  ignorance, and all the vicious snobberies transplanted from slave-bred
                  civilizations might endure for a day, but in the end they must give way before a
                  wider conception of existence.</p>
               <p>These comforting dreams, and the high expectation of peaceful days
                  ahead, were rudely shaken one wintry morning, when father was brought home
                  unconscious from the harness shop where he had found employment. The doctor’s
                  verdict was not encouraging. Father was rushed to the hospital: he should have had
                  medical attention long ago. That was the trouble with people, said the doctor
                  crossly. They let things go, and then expected miracles.</p>
               <p>It was true that father had been sick. He had been subject to
                  attacks of severe pains in the head, maddening jabs of burning intensity, that
                  left him faint and dizzy, and increasingly fearful lest he be found lagging at his
                  bench. A friend explained these things, and added, indignantly, that if his
                  condition was serious, the sweat-shop system under which men laboured in this land
                  of publicized liberty was certainly not blameless.</p>
               <p>‘Perhaps not—perhaps not,’ the doctor muttered, and amended
                  hastily: ‘None the less, it would have happened eventually, my good woman.’</p>
               <p>His reaction and reasoning were sound enough. His attitude, if not
                  his words, belied what he honestly believed, and for the best of reasons refrained
                  from saying. There was nothing to be gained by putting rebellious ideas into the
                  heads of immigrants, who must, as a matter of course, sweat for their daily bread.
                  No sense in setting the slave against his master, when every good Christian knew,
                  on biblical authority, that obedience was the prescribed duty of the one, and the
                  power of life and death the prerogative of the other. Furthermore, any reasonable
                  person understood what sacrifices an employer made when he invested capital in an
                  enterprise that afforded a livelihood for others.</p>
               <p>How true! Something certainly must be said of the overwhelming
                  sacrifices involved in this particular instance. And yet, since truth is generally
                  such an affront to the best people—and, of course, in the very worst taste—I must
                  refrain from mentioning actual names. I shall call the gentleman Mr. Brant, and
                  his philanthropic institution ‘The Saddlery’. To further ease the stain on tender
                  sensibilities, be it marked that the good man has long since departed this life
                  for fields of wider, if vaguer, possibilities.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brant was a native of Ontario, and admirably fitted the picture
                  of most so-called supermen of industry. He was shrewd, intelligent, though
                  uneducated, ruthless in principle, and utterly indifferent to criticism. He was a
                  harness-maker by trade, though not a very good one—a detail that in no way
                  affected his career, for his first stroke of genius was the selection of a partner
                  who furnished both skill and capital for their initial undertaking. His own
                  contribution was superb executive ability and the iron heel of the born
                  aggressor.</p>
               <p>Shortly after his arrival in Winnipeg he set up a small shop,
                  which, due to the nature of the times as much as to business ability, grew with
                  amazing rapidity. It must be remembered that transport was still largely dependent
                  on ox, mule, and horse power. Freighting into the territories and up the lakes, to
                  mention nothing else, was a highly profitable occupation that commanded hundreds
                  of teams, with all that that implies. In other words, harness shops and
                  harness-makers were as essential to that mode of life as the petrol vendor to-day,
                  and required no more genius to exploit their wares.</p>
               <p>Every hamlet and town had its harness-maker, who, before the
                  ultimate rise of Mr. Brant, derived a steady though modest living from his trade.
                  These brother craftsmen of the future leather luminary differed from him in
                  little, save their point of view. Which is to say, they were simple souls who
                  valued existence apart from business, whereas to Mr. Brant anything without a
                  dollar mark, plus one hundred per cent profit, was as worthless as a prairie
                  sunset.</p>
               <p>When my father entered his employ the business had been moved to an
                  old shop on the market street. It was an abandoned skating-rink, long, low, and
                  gloomy, with small-paned windows that admitted inadequate light and no
                  ventilation. In summer the rain leaked down through the rotting roof, and in
                  winter the frost coated the walls. Mr. Brant, with his eye on a fortune, found
                  better uses for his profits than to squander them on emasculating comforts. If
                  some weakling was always keeling over, that was his own misfortune, and no concern
                  of the Winnipeg Saddlery. All that was made very clear to each applicant. Mr.
                  Brant assumed no obligations whatsoever, aside from the payment of wages agreed
                  upon. This varied from seventy-five cents to a dollar for a ten-hour day.
                  Piece-work, which was naturally urged upon the uninitiated, was priced so low
                  that, however proficient a man might be, it was impossible to earn more than sixty
                  or seventy cents a day. A six-foot trace of heaviest leather, which had to be
                  double stitched by hand, brought thirty cents. No holiday was paid for, nor the
                  slightest favour granted to any one. The oldest, most faithful employee was fined
                  if a moment late, whatever his justification. As might be expected, Mr. Brant
                  instantly and effectively killed every effort to unionize the shop. He had no
                  intention of permitting anarchy to take root in his establishment, nor had any
                  need of advice on matters of organization and management. He had perfected a
                  highly satisfactory, not to say ingenious, system whereby his power and profits
                  increased from year to year. It was really a beautiful arrangement, for it cost
                  him nothing financially, and the burden of its operations rested upon his luckless
                  employees.</p>
               <p>It was not a new, but a trusty sweat-shop manœuvre ever dear to the
                  autocrat, whose opportunity is the extremity of others. He kept a sharp watch for
                  arriving immigrants, and hired as many as possible. These unskilled surplus hands
                  were utilized in odd jobs, for which they received a pittance, and free
                  instruction in a lucrative trade. The instructors were, of course, chosen from the
                  best, and, so far as it applies, highest-paid men, who thus dug their own economic
                  graves. For so soon as the new-comers qualified for the jobs, they got them, at a
                  lower wage. And out went the old-timers, unless they accepted a similar
                  reduction.</p>
               <p>Because of his skill as a saddle-maker father had not experienced
                  any difficulty in getting his job. The difficulty then and for years to come, was
                  to keep the family alive on the wages. To those who benefited by the times, this
                  may sound like an overstatement, born of malice and resentment. For it is seldom
                  that the fortunate are willing to concede that a combination of circumstances that
                  favoured them might have ruined others. Yet the truth is that even in those days
                  of supposedly easy opportunity it required some capital to take advantage of
                  them—or, if not capital, its equivalent in unhampered and unencumbered energy.
                  But, without money, the man who had dependents stood no better chance of attaining
                  to financial security in old Winnipeg than did his fellow workers in other cities
                  of the world.</p>
               <p>A little plain arithmetic may absolve me from wilful heresy. Mr.
                  Brant’s wage scale, it has been seen, made it almost impossible for a piece-worker
                  to earn more than five or six dollars a week. Which, at the most, adds up to
                  twenty-four dollars a month. From that, at least five dollars must be deducted for
                  house rent; another three or four for firewood and kerosene during moderately cold
                  weather, and usually twice that amount in the bitter winter months. At best, then,
                  that leaves only fifteen dollars to spread over the needs of an entire family—that
                  is to say, for food, and clothing, and medical services, and such incidentals as
                  even the poor cannot evade.</p>
               <p>But food, we sometimes hear it said, was so plentiful and cheap
                  that no one need have suffered any actual lack. The inference being, that none
                  save the thriftless sinner could have escaped luxury. So far as I remember,
                  however, the Icelandic immigrant was neither given to idleness nor excess, yet his
                  table was restricted to the plainest, most meagre fare. What meat he had was
                  usually pickled sheep’s head—for these could be bought at five cents each at the
                  slaughter house (it was not called abattoir then!)—or shank bone for the soup
                  kettle, or now and then a bit of liver, when onions were on hand to dress the
                  dish. As for other commodities: flour sold at $2.50 the hundredweight; sugar at
                  fourteen pounds for the dollar; butter from fifteen to twenty-five cents a pound;
                  lard, five cents; and green coffee, which every housewife roasted in her own bake
                  oven, sold at six pounds for the dollar.</p>
               <p>A little quiet speculation on these seemingly low prices, as seen
                  in ratio to the wages paid, will prove, I think, that the average immigrant family
                  that strove to maintain some sort of respectability under these conditions might
                  just as well have dreamed of a mansion on the moon as of sharing in the many
                  profitable opportunities which were open to men of a little means.</p>
               <p>I remember that one of the few grievances that my amiable father
                  nursed against fate was that when lots were selling at five dollars on Nina Street
                  (now Sherbrooke) he could never manage to scrape up the money. In a few years
                  those lots were selling for hundreds of dollars, and by the time I had reached my
                  teens many a tidy fortune had been made from those city blocks. But to me, the
                  wonder was, not that the family fell short of financial grace, but that it should
                  have survived those awful early years, unaided and intact.</p>

               <head>First Taste of the New World</head>
               <p>It is not my intention to recount all the melancholy privations
                  through which the family struggled, always, by some miracle of inward solace,
                  maintaining a fairly cheerful atmosphere. For nothing ever dampened my father’s
                  belief in the essential business of life, which he held to be the evolution of
                  character. Nor was my mother long cast down by tribulation. Her courage and humour
                  was equal to almost any trial. But this first winter brought her to the point of
                  despair.</p>
               <p>Father, it was discovered at the hospital, had an abscess in the
                  lower brain, caused by an injury received years before in a shipwreck. It was
                  decided that an operation, though delicate in the extreme, might save him, but the
                  hope held out was slight indeed. Fortunately for us, the Winnipeg Hospital, though
                  small and under-staffed, was none the less fairly well equipped, and the tiny
                  operating-room under a most able surgeon. In view of the difficulties under which
                  the new hospital had had its rise, it seems fitting to mention its early
                  beginning, and those ‘old-timers’ who bore the brunt of its inauguration.</p>
               <p>It was after the first Riel Rebellion that the need for hospital
                  accommodation was first felt. Many of the volunteers had remained in Winnipeg, and
                  new settlers kept pouring in over the newly opened Dawson trail, and by way of St.
                  Paul. The houses of the town were soon overcrowded, and consequently when sickness
                  broke out the necessity for some place where patients could be properly cared for
                  became apparent.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, in 1871 a meeting was called by Governor Archibald to
                  deal with the problem, and among those present were Robert Cunningham, James Ross,
                  Hon. A. G. B. Bannantyne, Hon. Alfred Boyd, and Dr. J. H. O’Donnell. At the
                  meeting, a Board of Health was formed, and steps were taken to begin hospital
                  work. On the 13th of December of the following year the hospital was organized,
                  but it was not until the 14th of May 1875 that Provincial letters of incorporation
                  were taken out—a step rendered necessary by an appeal to the Provincial Government
                  for assistance.</p>
               <p>At that time the board of directors consisted of Messrs. George
                  Young, Gilbert McMicken, W. Kennedy, W. C. Clark, Thomas Lusted, G. B. Spence,
                  George Bryce, A. G. B. Bannantyne, J. H. Ashdown, Stewart Mulvy, A. G. Jackson, J.
                  H. O’Donnell, Joseph Royal, J. H. McTavish, and W. G. Fonseca.</p>
               <p>The first building occupied by the hospital was owned by Mr.
                  William Harvey, and was situated on the north-west corner of McDermot and Albert
                  Streets, where the once-famed Marriaggi Hotel afterwards stood. This became the
                  Winnipeg General Hospital. The accommodation here was, however, quickly exhausted,
                  and the hospital was moved to other quarters, somewhere in the rear of the present
                  Bank of Montreal, and shortly thereafter to yet another house on Notre Dame
                  Avenue, owned by Dr. Shultz. From there the hospital was transferred to premises
                  owned by Mr. John McTavish, situated on the Red River, south of Broadway Bridge.
                  In 1875 another move was found imperative, and the choice fell on property owned
                  by the late Hon. John Norquay, somewhere on Main Street North. And the sixth move
                  was to a house owned by the hospital, between Bannantyne and McDermot, close to
                  the present location, on land donated by the late A. G. B. Bannantyne. This
                  location was selected with a view to placing the hospital in a section of the city
                  which in time would be most central to the needs of the future. The wisdom of the
                  choice continues unquestioned.</p>
               <p>The building here erected accommodated sixteen public-ward patients
                  and four private patients, and had a small operating-room. But the hospital had
                  yet another move to make before its final installation in the buildings which
                  formed the nucleus of the present imposing structure. This new ‘flitting’ was
                  altogether unavoidable. With the beginning of the C.P.R. construction the sudden
                  influx of settlers rendered the little hospital inadequate. While arrangements
                  were being made to collect funds for the necessary extensions, the hospital was
                  moved to the Dominion Immigration Hall on Point Douglas Common, which was
                  purchased from the Government for five thousand dollars. In this building what was
                  then considered a complete operating equipment was provided at a cost of seven
                  hundred and sixty-two dollars, and private wards were improvised by screening off
                  portions of the public wards.</p>
               <p>The erection of the new hospital, the central portion of the
                  present buildings, was a long and tedious undertaking. It was decided that the lot
                  donated to the institution by the late A. G. B. Bannantyne and A. McDermot was not
                  large enough, and this was exchanged for a block of ground west of Olivia Street,
                  and the adjoining block was purchased from the executors of the McDermot Estate
                  for five thousand dollars. Penelope Street, between these two blocks, was closed,
                  and here the first building of the present group was erected. This decision was
                  made in 1882, and the official opening of the Winnipeg General Hospital took place
                  in 1884.</p>
               <p>It was to this arduously acquired little hospital, which the
                  old-timers saw as a symbol of the height of humanitarian progress in the west,
                  that my poor father was taken that bitter day. His case created something of a
                  sensation. Up to that time no such operation had been attempted in the modest
                  surgery. What was lacking in equipment was earnestly supplied by sheer ability and
                  conscientious goodwill. Certainly no surgeon ever accomplished a more skilful
                  operation, despite his own doubts of the experiment, and the complete scepticism
                  of his assistants. No one, it seems, expected the patient to live. It was in the
                  interest of science, rather than of the fever-wracked form on the operating-table,
                  that the brilliant attempt was made. But there was incredible vitality in that
                  pale, slight frame. He not only survived the experiment, but made such a rapid
                  recovery that, ironically enough, it inspired an almost criminal optimism which
                  nearly cost his life. There was certainly no intentional negligence, no one in
                  particular to blame for what happened. Father was cared for as well as the
                  public-ward facilities permitted. But the hospital was crowded. When, therefore,
                  in four weeks’ time, he appeared sufficiently recovered, he was discharged. It was
                  February, and bitterly cold. With his head still swathed in bandages, and no
                  better covering than a threadbare tweed lightcoat, he had to walk over a mile
                  through a gathering storm. As might be expected, what should have been a joyous
                  return, and for which my mother had celebrated with pathetic pride—setting the
                  table with coffee and real cream and rolled Icelandic pancakes—resolved itself
                  into overwhelming tragedy. The severe chill brought on brain fever, and for seven
                  weeks he alternated between wild delirium and terrifying coma.</p>
               <p>Mother could never speak of those weeks without a shudder. There
                  was no one to whom she could turn. My aunt, who would have been a tower of
                  strength, had moved away, having fixed upon the United States as a much more
                  progressive country. How, then, was the little family to live? Father had to be
                  nursed night and day, a task almost beyond the strength of one woman during those
                  delirious hours. The landlord was willing enough to wait for his rent, but there
                  was fuel and food and medicine to be bought. She tried to knit, which meant that,
                  in the rare intervals when the patient was quiet and she should have slept, she
                  forced her tired eyes to remain open by dashing cold water on them, kept herself
                  from collapsing by drinking black coffee. As a consequence of these pathetic
                  labours her sight was impaired to such an extent that she eventually lost the use
                  of one eye.</p>
               <p>Yet, however hard she drove herself, these efforts would not have
                  kept him alive if the best of men had not come to her assistance and lent her a
                  supply of groceries. This benefactor was a Mr. Fredrickson, an Icelandic small
                  merchant, whom many a family remembers for similar kindness. Another Icelander, a
                  man who worked with father in ‘The Saddlery’, took up a subscription of fifteen
                  dollars from those poor wage-slaves to defer medical expenses and buy a cord of
                  wood. For these things, mother was deeply grateful, yet I think nothing ever hurt
                  her more. She was the kind of woman who found it easy to give but extremely
                  difficult to receive.</p>
               <p>Father’s recovery was, of course, extremely slow. After weeks at
                  home, the doctor decided that he must have better care, and consequently, as soon
                  as he could be moved with safety, father went back to the hospital, this time to
                  remain for three weary months. So soon as these arrangements had been completed
                  mother gave up the house and took three tiny upstairs rooms for herself and the
                  children. Now, at last, she felt free to go to work, in order to pay off those
                  frightening, pyramiding debts. She had the will and the courage, yet how, she
                  asked herself, could it be done, when the younger child was scarcely more than a
                  baby? In this dilemma she was forced to accept a solution that violated her deeply
                  maternal instincts. A dearly beloved cousin of father’s, Malfridur Borgford,
                  offered to adopt the child. It was a cruel decision for mother to make, yet
                  better, perhaps, than shunting the little girl back and forth among strangers who
                  would not consider her best interests. It was a bitter concession to her own
                  helplessness. But then, had not everything been cruelly bitter in this new
                  country? In her despair she tried to reason that, whatever might her innermost
                  feelings, little Anna would fare better for the sacrifice. She would be loved and
                  conscientiously cared for at the Borgford’s. Indeed, she would be spared the
                  wounding privations which, instinct told her, the small son she was keeping would,
                  perforce, have to bear.</p>
               <p>Yes, it was highly sensible to let the child go. So she told
                  herself again and again. It was cold comfort, however, when on the appointed day,
                  from her bleak window she watched the little creature trot gaily away, all
                  unsuspectingly, with her Auntie Malfridur. It was a beautiful spring morning, one
                  of those bright prairie days when the eyes are pained by the reflected brilliance
                  of a whitely golden sun. For the watcher at the window, whose tearful eyes were
                  fixed upon a sturdy little figure marching bravely out into the unequivocal
                  distance, there was no beauty in the dazzling white landscape, no light in the
                  sky.</p>
               <p>But grief, like everything else, was a luxury, mother told herself
                  harshly. There was no time for tears. She had work to find—any kind of work. And
                  how gladly she toiled! How proudly and gratefully she counted each dollar that,
                  bit by bit, would cancel those intolerable obligations. Yet what must her feelings
                  have been each morning, when she left to his own devices a little boy of six? A
                  merry little fellow, whose youth was already doomed to premature age and
                  responsibility. Poor little lad, how fortunate that, of all her children, he had
                  the sweetest disposition and the most pliable mind. Gravely, the little boy
                  promised to be good, oh, very, very good. Not to forget to feed the cat, nor to
                  let it annoy the neighbours. In the evening his reward would be a story, a very
                  thrilling story of brave men and maids. Perhaps a fairy tale or two if mamma had
                  much mending to do.</p>
               <p>So the months passed. When father came home at last the three rooms
                  were very festive. There were curtains at the windows, and two brand-new chairs!
                  The stove shone like the face of a saint, and fumes of freshly roasted coffee made
                  a joyous incense. And, can you believe it, there were five silver spoons and three
                  china cups on the table!</p>
               <p>And so this chapter, which I report from hearsay (though, truth to
                  tell, it seems odd I wasn’t there to glory in the spoons) comes to an end. For the
                  summer was an uneventful interlude in which the invalid kept house with the little
                  son, and gathered strength for renewed battle. In the autumn father was back at
                  the saddlery, and mother, once more confined to the house, was finally launched
                  upon her lifelong battle for respectability.</p>
               <p>The next year the family moved to a fairly decent brick house on
                  Bushnell Street. And here, at midday, on the 9th of December 1890, I had the bad
                  manners to interrupt my mother in the midst of making head-cheese—and for no
                  better reason than to be born.</p>

               <head>Subjective Interlude</head>
               <p>‘The thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.’ So says the poet.
                  To which sentiment most people agree, although, too often, without much
                  understanding. The cheerful agreement applies to far, faint, mythical individuals,
                  to people beyond the common ken. For how often, on recalling something that deeply
                  impressed me, I have been told, ‘You could not remember that. Of course you could
                  not—you were such a child!’ As though there were a point, or divisional place
                  fixed by years, where consciousness begins and a purely vegetable existence ends.
                  As a matter of fact, the thoughts of early childhood are the longest thoughts of
                  all. They persist through life, not, perhaps, as distinct images or ideas, but as
                  sharp, unalterable reactions, such as sympathies and phobias. Vague, unrelated,
                  often distorted and but dimly understood, these child thoughts are, none the less,
                  full of exquisite wonder, wing-swift surprise, and indelible pain. They are indeed
                  the stuff from which the world evolves, the mysterious matrix of which the
                  emotional life is made.</p>
               <p>In my own case scarcely any situation in human relationships has
                  escaped a tempering shadow from some such long-gone experience. Not that I
                  reasoned about it, weighed and measured, and drew conclusions. It was all quite
                  unconscious as are all our so-called spontaneous reactions. That there is no such
                  thing as an unconditioned response to the calls of life I sincerely believe. I
                  think that, just as the tonal quality of a violin depends upon the delicate
                  process of weathering, so the sensitivity of the human mind depends, to a
                  remarkable degree, upon the stress and strain of childhood thoughts and
                  emotions.</p>
               <p>It follows that events, in themselves, are of no importance except
                  as they incite and react upon consciousness. In its final analysis, life, for each
                  of us, is nothing more than a series of sense impressions. And these impressions,
                  depending as they do upon the normal or abnormal functioning of the physical
                  organs of sense and the sympathetic nervous system, necessarily reveal unto each
                  of us a world thus limited to our individual comprehension and mental reserves.
                  Consequently, none of us can ever actually see ‘eye to eye’, as the foolish saying
                  goes, nor sense the same shade of beauty and blemish in any given experience. And
                  yet, because we live for no better reason than to reveal our particular slant on
                  the riddle of existence, we must proclaim truth as we see it. But not, I think,
                  without a qualifying humility which readily admits that, so far as one’s
                  individual conception goes, truth is a purely relative term. The same applies to
                  all human judgements. To argue that anything in human experience is of itself,
                  aside from its reactions upon the individual, either great or small, is a
                  confession of insensitive stupidity.</p>
               <p>For example, to the man of action physical hardships hold little
                  terror, yet a contest of words with a narrow bigot may put him to rout—which
                  proves nothing, except that each is adept in his own obsession. Furthermore, bound
                  as we are within the individual consciousness, it is ridiculous to expect more
                  than comparative understanding from even our dearest associates. For instance, a
                  practical soul, however generous, would never instinctively understand why any one
                  should weep over the simple act of tossing away a sheaf of withered flowers.
                  Practical natures are not prone to vagrant dreams, nor even dimly aware of the
                  bright immortality of illusive ideas. It is not in such a one to understand how
                  the dreaming heart cries out against the swift eclipse of beauty, and mourns with
                  a mist of tears the golden leaves of a thousand yesterdays. Such facile, foolish
                  pain is very real to me—real as the purple shadows that veil in mystery the
                  sailing horn of the young moon, and the little winds that run before the night on
                  softly whispering feet. Real as are all the innermost senses which life has
                  stirred to passion by its flaming sword.</p>

               <head>God’s Fields</head>
               <p>I don’t know how old I was that early morning when I awakened with
                  a start, and knew at once that something was wrong in the house. It was so
                  unearthly quiet. Ordinarily, at this hour, mamma would be banging about in the
                  kitchen, scraping the breakfast pots, or rubbing away on the washboard. Then, too,
                  little brother, who of late had cried so much in a thin wailing voice, wasn’t in
                  his cradle, nor making the least sound, wherever he was. That was queer, I
                  thought, staring at the empty cradle, and straining my ears for the familiar
                  sound. Sitting there on the edge of the bed, it seemed to me that the silence
                  thickened about me, pressed in on me like a September fog swirling in from damp
                  brown marshes, and the chill of it raised sharp pinpricks on my bare arms and
                  legs. I was being foolish, I knew. The make-believe side of my mind was playing
                  tricks on me. It was what I had been told would happen unless I mended my
                  wool-gathering ways. With an effort of will I wriggled forward on the bed,
                  reaching out for my clothes on a near-by chair. And then, more frightening than
                  the silence, came a sound that almost stopped my heart.</p>
               <p>It was a strangled cry, that hurt to hear because it was so quickly
                  suppressed, smothered in painful, muffled weeping. Petrified, I sat there
                  clutching my clothes, waiting the world’s end. For that was mamma weeping. My
                  cheerful, energetic mamma, whose eyes had a way of twinkling at you even through
                  the misty vapours of the washtub, and who always found a laugh to heal my childish
                  tears. Then, in further confirmation that my small world was sorely amiss, I heard
                  papa’s voice, low and indistinct, but with some quality so pitiful vibrating
                  through it that my breath caught in my throat. Gathered in a lump that threatened
                  to choke me. Oh, something was very, very wrong, since papa was home on this shiny
                  summer morning, for I knew he was not sick. But now I must find out for myself,
                  take my share in the terrifying mystery. Oh, hurry, hurry, I said to my fingers,
                  which were suddenly all thumbs as they worked at buttonholes now too small for the
                  buttons. I wanted to rush out to that grief-stricken room, to throw myself on
                  mamma’s breast, to comfort and be comforted. That was what I wanted. Yet, when I
                  had dressed at last, I dared not open the excluding door. No, I dared not. With my
                  hand on the knob, and my heart beating in my throat, I somehow understood that
                  those tears and hesitant commiserations were not for me to look upon. I would go,
                  instead, to the front room, and wait for the melancholy sounds to subside.</p>
               <p>When I slipped into the small parlour (which was, of course, no
                  real parlour such as the minister had, but just the room where mamma’s chest of
                  drawers, her black rocker, a braided mat, and a table with flowering plants gave
                  an air of mild formality) and had shut the door behind me, I beheld a thing that
                  made me rub my eyes. In the middle of the room, supported by two chairs, was the
                  loveliest white bed. I assumed that it was a bed, although so tiny and narrow, for
                  little brother was sleeping in it. He was sleeping so sweetly that I almost feared
                  to breathe as I stole forward on tiptoe for a better look at this strange white
                  resting-place.</p>
               <p>Who shall say how knowledge comes to a child? There was nothing but
                  innocent curiosity in my mind as I drew nearer on silent, cautious feet, and yet,
                  all at once, I was filled with the startling consciousness that here was no
                  ordinary sleep. Never before had little brother slept in such waxen quietude, his
                  tiny hands utterly at rest on his small bosom. Strange, inviolate sleep! Strange,
                  silent little face, that not even the weaving light from the window stirred from
                  its graven peace. What was here I could not understand. I none the less
                  comprehended it was not for me to spy upon. Little brother had acquired some
                  special significance as remote as the stars and too deep for curiosity. He was so
                  beautiful, lying there in his snowy bed, that my whole breast ached, and I envied
                  him a little.</p>
               <p>Quietly I crept to the window, and noted with astonishment that,
                  just as on other days, the local boys were playing in the muddy pool by the corner
                  pump. Nothing was changed in the street. There, every familiar activity proceeded
                  as was usual. Like puppies at play, the boys pushed and pummelled each other,
                  their bare feet splashing through the saffron water. A woman in a trailing black
                  skirt hurried by, a wicker market basket on her stout red arm. The baker in his
                  red cart rumbled through the ruts, and the postman, cheerily whistling, plodded
                  on. Nothing at all in this outer shell of the world was the least affected,
                  although the inner citadel trembled around me.</p>
               <p>I don’t know how long I had hovered there, mutely miserable, when
                  papa came in. ‘Come, child,’ he said, ‘you must dress.’ An odd command, surely,
                  for had I not already accomplished that vexatious feat? Could he not see that even
                  my dress was neatly buttoned, and my shoe-laces tied? The look on his face, grave
                  and weary, held me silent. Meekly, I followed into the kitchen, where the smell of
                  coffee enheartened me a little. Then, too, I saw that mamma was not crying now.
                  She sat by the stove, her fine, restless hands for once idle in her lap. She did
                  not look at me, however. Dressed in her dark green alpaca Sunday grown, she sat,
                  straightly and still, with eyes fixed on some inner mystery that left me worlds
                  apart.</p>
               <p>We were going somewhere, it seemed. I dared not ask where. I dared
                  not so much as wriggle when papa, unaccustomed to such a task, tried his best to
                  comb my hair, and cruelly pulled the snarls. When he fetched the red cashmere
                  dress from the closet I put it on without a murmur. I even ate a dish of hated
                  porridge because he said I must. It was just as I finished that a knock on the
                  door came as a welcome deliverance, and a big man in a frock coat entered with his
                  hat in his hand. He nodded at papa, and, bowing a little, addressed mamma in a
                  kind, solemn voice.</p>
               <p>‘I wish I were here on a brighter errand,’ he said, ‘that there was
                  something I could say—but what are words? It is hard—hard.’</p>
               <p>‘Thank you, Mr. Bardal,’ mother answered, in a cold small voice.
                  ‘We are ready, as you see.’</p>
               <p>We went out and there at the door stood a hack with two black
                  horses switching their gleaming tails. ‘Papa—papa,’ I whispered in rising elation
                  that instantly died when he touched his lips for silence. It was all beyond
                  comprehension. Here were we, who never went abroad in style, about to ride forth
                  in a fine carriage such as the rich folk used for pleasure, and not one word of
                  joy to be said. One by one, we climbed in and took our places, and
                  then—astonishingly true—the tall stranger brought out little brother’s bed, now
                  completely covered with a crinkly velvet lid, and set it between us. Then the
                  horses were off, stepping daintily as ladies over the rutted road.</p>
               <p>There was so much I wanted to ask, so many confusing thoughts
                  crowding my troubled mind, but as neither parent seemed even remotely aware of my
                  presence I fell to watching the streets. Strange streets, full of sound and
                  movement, interesting enough in their fashion, for even then the panorama of human
                  beings pouring from an unknown past to an unguessed future intrigued me. Yet all
                  this was quickly forgotten when the noisy streets gave way to an open road. No
                  more ugly houses; no more cluttered shops; no more hasting, harried people. As far
                  as the eye could travel, green fields flowed on and on under a cloudless sky
                  toward a far, blue horizon.</p>
               <p>It was the prairie in its sweetest dress, the tall grasses stirring
                  in a little wind, with yellow daisies and shy blue flowers nodding as we passed.
                  It was the prairie as I was always to love it, breathing something fine and free
                  that stole into my heart. It lay there under the amber summer sun, so big and so
                  beautiful that I thought God must have made it in some gentle moment for His own
                  White Company—for the angels that walked the earth by night.</p>
               <p>The fancy so pleased me that I could hardly believe my eyes when
                  this broidered carpet of green was rudely broken by a high iron fence. An ugly,
                  chilling enclosure, wherein lay rows and rows of wooden crosses and cold white
                  stones. And here the horses stopped. The tall man, more grave than ever, lifted
                  out the little bed, and mamma and papa stepped down from the carriage. For the
                  first time that morning mamma took note of me.</p>
               <p>‘Stay where you are, child,’ she said. ‘Your shoes are thin, and
                  the ground is damp.’</p>
               <p>I did not want to enter that place of stones, yet the tears leaped
                  to my eyes. I wanted to run into those wide, green fields, where the variegated
                  flowers waved in the sunlight. I wanted so passionately to set my feet on that
                  soft, sun-drenched carpet rolling away to the blue, that, when I was left, I
                  buried my face in my hands to shut out the beauty I might not share.</p>
               <p>I think the tall, grave stranger must have dearly loved children,
                  and read their hearts aright. I think he understood my infant misery, and quickly
                  guessed the source of its hurt. I like so to believe, for after a little he
                  returned to the carriage with a handful of prairie flowers.</p>
               <p>‘There you are, little one,’ he smiled, slipping into my hands the
                  first bit of loveliness for which my soul thirsted. Dear, thoughtful heart! What,
                  to him, was a simple, kindly gesture, soon forgotten, was to me a precious gift,
                  treasured throughout the years.</p>
               <p>All the way home I hugged those lowly flowers to my breast—more
                  sweet by far than any garden blooms, for the dreams of the great green fields
                  enveloped them. In their little faces I read a thousand star-born mysteries, and
                  in their faint perfume found something exquisite and fairy fashioned. They so
                  absorbed me that I scarcely wondered why little brother had been left behind. It
                  was not until we were home again, and mamma, grey and tired, had set the table for
                  coffee, that the old anxiety returned to vex me. Dark questions flocked to my
                  mind, a dozen unanswered mysteries. Something restrained me. I could only stand
                  like a stick, clutching my flowers, ignored and forgotten, so it seemed.</p>
               <p>Papa, rousing from his own painful musings, noticed me. He tried to
                  smile, and the effort hurt me—as the sight of the sharp cold fence in that lovely
                  green waste had hurt me.</p>
               <p>‘Poor little Lalla. Give me the flowers,’ he said. ‘We must put
                  them in water, or they will die.’</p>
               <p>They will die! They will die! The words shot through my child
                  consciousness, tipped with terrible meaning. They will die! The words had been
                  meaningless heretofore. Now I understood. Oh yes, I understood, and with a little
                  cry I thrust my treasure into papa’s hands and fled into a corner. I could not
                  have said what hurt me so deeply, nor explained that the feeling in my heart was a
                  darker sister of the odd pain that always assailed me when I watched the sun go
                  down on golden wings in the west. I just knew that, whereas a moment ago I wanted
                  to be remembered, to be asked to fetch a cup, or the spoons, or the bread from the
                  pantry, I now wished to be left in my corner to face alone this strange new
                  understanding.</p>
               <p>But when I had gone to bed, and my prayers were ended, I pulled the
                  sheet up over my face, and cried in the silent way I had. I cried for the flowers
                  that were already dying when I hugged them to my breast. And I cried that little
                  brother and I had not been left together in the beautiful quiet of God’s fields. I
                  cried until my old grey cat, being cold, came stepping softly over the bed, and
                  nestled in my bosom.</p>

               <head>Those Child Transgressions</head>
               <p>My mother could never quite believe that I was not meant for the
                  realms above. So sure was she of my early demise that I began to be a little
                  impatient for the heavenly event. I used to imagine myself setting forth in great
                  state in the Little White Hearse—for of course I was much too big to be taken away
                  in a hack. After that I would flit about in a variety of wings, doing nothing in
                  particular, for my imagination failed me completely when it came to a working
                  programme in Paradise. It was really quite a jolly game, that helped me immensely
                  when I was bored with living cooped up in the house while other children whooped
                  and hollered around the village pump. My greatest disappointment centred in that
                  pastime. If only I might have trampled that delicious mud, I felt that even death
                  would not be too big a price. My second disappointment was God.</p>
               <p>God kept a very jealous eye on wilful children. That I was a victim
                  of this pestiferous sin I discovered one lovely morning when the sun was a
                  bristling disk in the sky, and the local children especially merry, splashing
                  through the puddles. Of course, I could not go out. There was a cold wind, my
                  mother said, and if I caught a chill, what might not happen! It was all very sad.
                  But, I thought to myself, just to open the window and hang out for a moment would
                  hardly amount to a very heinous sin. It was a thrilling experience—I even yelled a
                  little, just to show that after all I was not lacking in social graces. Perhaps I
                  wriggled. At any rate, down came the window with a terrifying clop right on my
                  wicked neck!</p>
               <p>My screams brought mother on the run. No doubt she was frightened
                  and envisioned who knows what injuries. When she saw that nothing much was amiss,
                  however, her temper, always quick, rose to the occasion.</p>
               <p>‘Now you see how God punishes naughty girls!’ she cried. ‘Perhaps,
                  after this, you’ll do as you’re told!’</p>
               <p>Well, for the most part, I always did. My mother had a sharp tongue
                  as well as a sharp eye. That I did not so much resent—mamma had so many soft
                  moments. But that God should plunk the window down on my neck struck me as both
                  ungentlemanly and unjust. From that day I had no use for the Deity. The angels
                  were exempt from this condemnation—they seemed to be a cheerful lot with cheerful
                  duties. And Jesus, the perennial Christmas Babe who later had to die for the sins
                  of the world wrung many tears from my heart. I could never understand why God
                  treated him so badly—except that God was just that kind of deity.</p>
               <p>But though my mother was apprehensive that every season was my last
                  (and who can blame her, when I was the only one of her babies born in those
                  arduous years to survive infancy, and then only to fall prey to awful sickness) it
                  was no excuse for ignorance. I had to learn a multitude of poems and prayers and
                  scriptural verses. That was not very difficult if the words had a musical sound
                  and a fitting rhythm. ‘Lift up your heads, O ye hills’ and ‘Yea, though ye slay
                  me, yet will I believe in Him’—such phrases had a fascination for me, entirely
                  apart from any meaning. And of all the many sacred verses, I loved best the lyric
                  passage:</p>
              
               <p>Dröttin blessi mig or mína</p>
               <p>Morgun kveld og nött or, dag,</p>
               <p>Dröttin vevji vaengi sína</p>
               <p>Míg um lífs of salar hag.</p>
               <p>A beautiful conception of a divinity (which I never connected with
                  an anthropomorphic God) that enfolded every living being in protective wings of
                  love.</p>
               <p>It was fun to learn these things, even if it seemed a little silly
                  to roll them off so regularly every night. Where I rebelled, with sad
                  consequences, was at the business of learning to read. Not that I was not thrilled
                  with the general idea, but when my mother brought out the old yellow-paged family
                  Bible for a text-book I struck for liberty and licence. I would not learn to read that musty volume. Besides, my mother’s choice was
                  sadly inept.</p>
               <p>‘And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt
                  Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am. And he said,
                  Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the
                  land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains
                  which I will tell thee of.’</p>
               <p>Slowly and seriously my mother read, her slender finger tracing the
                  words for me. Simple little words that brought a curious chill and as swift
                  rebellion to my mind.</p>
               <p>‘Now, child,’ said she, ‘see how far you can go. Spell out the
                  letters, and it won’t be hard.’</p>
               <p>Bleakly I looked at her. Well, let the heavens fall and all dark
                  doom swallow me up—my mind was set. ‘I won’t read,’ I said. ‘I won’t read a single
                  word, mamma.’</p>
               <p>I think she would have been less surprised if I had bitten her.</p>
               <p>‘You won’t read?’ she repeated helplessly, and, snatching at saving
                  reason, quickly asked, ‘Are you sick? Does your head ache?’</p>
               <p>‘No, mamma, I am not sick.’</p>
               <p>‘What’s the matter with you then? Stop being silly and do as you
                  are told.’</p>
               <p>She might as well have spoken to a stone: neither argument nor
                  reprimand moved me. I was wicked, I knew, and resigned to an evil fate, but not to
                  reading such mischievous stuff. That fate, in the guise of a dark cupboard under
                  the stairs quickly befell me. It was frightfully black, and I was sure that a
                  thousand mice were nibbling in the corners. I sat there with my sins and waited
                  for eternity to pass. I did not cry. I just sat there listening to the imaginary
                  mice, and wondering how long it would be until they had eaten everything else, and
                  would begin on me.</p>
               <p>At least a hundred years had dragged by when I heard my father come
                  home, and the next moment found myself hauled up before him in all my dusty
                  iniquity. Said my indignant mother, when the chronicle of my unconscionable revolt
                  ended, ‘Now, young lady, perhaps you’ll think differently, and obey like a
                  sensible child.’</p>
               <p>To which I instantly replied—quite as though she had pressed a
                  button and released a prepared answer: ‘Now I’ll never learn to read, mother.’</p>
               <p>It may have been her unfailing sense of humour which saved me from
                  further pressure, which undoubtedly would have had a serious psychological effect.
                  Or there may have been something in my strained white face that actually
                  frightened her. She was never one to understand mental complexes or straitened
                  emotional states. So now, rather than cope with something at once ridiculous and
                  incredible, for I was usually obedient and completely ruled by her influence, she
                  left me where I was, disgraced and contemptible, and hurried to the kitchen.
                  Father said nothing, and quietly slipped out of the house. When he returned there
                  was a whimsical smile on his face, and in his hand a small pink book. Quite as
                  though nothing unusual were afoot, he exhibited his purchase so that I should see
                  in all its shining wonder the fine frontispiece. There, bold as you please, stood
                  a chubby little chap with a bundle on a stick jauntily perched over one shoulder.
                  His cap sat crookedly, and his round face beamed. He was utterly adorable, and I
                  promptly fell in love with him.</p>
               <p>‘This is Master Neils,’ father told me. ‘A gay young fellow, with
                  adventure in his soul. He is setting forth to see the world. Now, how would you
                  like to join in the journey, little miss?’</p>
               <p>I was already upon his knees, my eyes glued to the charming
                  creature. I was speechless for the thumping in my breast.</p>
               <p>‘Ah, I see that you do,’ said papa. ‘Well, then, you must learn to
                  read. That, my dear, is the very best way to journey about the world.’</p>
               <p>Thus was I saved, and, needless to say, I loved that little pink
                  book above any other. It was not only my key to dreams, but a passport into a
                  kingdom of understanding that has to do with charities to which the Marthas of
                  this world remain for ever blind. I was to remember that trifling incident many
                  times, and out of it grew the perception that, like liberty, true benevolence is a
                  quality of mind.</p>
               <p>That my mother had assumed the role of a commanding executive in
                  our household was not exactly her fault. By nature she was gay and instinctively
                  averse from conventional strictures that loom so all-important to the average
                  woman. There was no sacred order in her house. If the weekly paper arrived in the
                  midst of washday she would let the water cool and read the serial with no qualms
                  whatsoever. Water could always be reheated, but enthusiasm, once cooled, was stale
                  as a dry herring. We had our meals at the prescribed hours, although, for herself,
                  she cherished no such boresome ritual. No one ever had less interest in food. How
                  she managed to keep so healthy on such sketchy fare is still a mystery. ‘If I’m
                  not hungry, why should I eat?’ she would say, and sit down with a cup of
                  poisonously strong coffee and her endless knitting. It was the same with clothes.
                  Now, why should she bundle up against the weather, when she never took a chill? In
                  zero weather she hung out the steaming wash, dressed in nothing warmer than a
                  cotton gown and undergarments made from carefully bleached flour sacking. ‘Well,
                  what of it?’ she would parry. She never caught cold, and, besides, was immune to
                  all diseases.</p>
               <p>For her children, it was another story. I, at least, was swaddled
                  in clothes, made to eat when I had no appetite, and, it now seems to me, actually
                  was coddled into the invalidism she meant to avoid. Indeed, it became a kind of
                  sin for me to even think of behaving like other children—a frightful challenge to
                  evil fate even to dream of being well. I suspect there was a wide streak of
                  jealous possessiveness in her character which fixed upon the one thing the world
                  could not snatch from her—the affection of her children. Yet even in this she was
                  not altogether successful. In my case, at least, it was papa who figured actively
                  in my infant brooding. For no matter how gentle and kind mamma might be, and
                  everlastingly concerned for my health, I knew quite well that it was papa who came
                  nearer to understanding me. That this incipient understanding was not permitted to
                  grow and outlast childhood was, I think, my mother’s fault. In the end, she weaned
                  me completely away, made an alien of the parent whose vagaries I share, and, as I
                  now know, diverted my normal instincts into channels of activity for which I had
                  no natural talents.</p>
               <p>None of this my loving mother meant to do. She was always
                  pathetically eager to plan some happiness for us, to join in the gaiety, however
                  tired she might be. Those early years of unrelieved privation had concentrated
                  into one unbearable memory. Her small son weeping out his heart because on
                  Christmas Eve, when he had set out so stoutly through the storm to attend the
                  church concert, there was not even so much as a red apple on the tree for him. She
                  had not wanted him to go, but he had argued so defensively out of his child’s high
                  faith. He had been so good—and did not God love good children? He had watched
                  little sister while mamma worked and tried his best to wait on papa, who was sick
                  in bed. Oh, there would be something on the Christ Child’s lovely tree for him—he
                  would not be forgotten because he was little and shy and so very poor.</p>
               <p>So now, when things were a little easier—when there was sometimes
                  as much as seven dollars in the weekly pay envelope—why, she naturally was
                  determined to make the most of every festival. My birthday was always a great
                  occasion. I think it marked a sort of conquest over the fear that dogged her mind.
                  I might be doomed, as one doctor had hinted to perish before I ever reached the
                  teens, but each birthday was a milestone conquered. There was one particular
                  birthday I shall never forget. I think I was seven or thereabout. Years did not
                  mean so much, nor do they yet. At any rate, on this occasion mother had set her
                  mind on a big party, a real Icelandic splurge. How hard she worked, God love her.
                  What piles of her paper-thin and widely famed pancakes she made. How fine her fig
                  cake looked in its gleaming brown frosting with the golden flecks winking gem-like
                  on its proud head. What delicious odours teased my curious nose when the Icelandic
                  coffee-bread came from the hot oven. Oh, it was a gallant time, let me tell
                  you!</p>
               <p>Nor was that the whole of it. Deep mysteries were brewing. I was
                  sent to bed and enjoined to stay there on pain of severe displeasure, while mother
                  remained in the dim secrecy of the dining-room. She was sewing something I must
                  not see, that I quickly surmised, and squirmed and tossed with curiosity. As a
                  rule I was not given to snooping, for I had scarcely any interest in the events of
                  the common round. The world of my own imagination was much more intriguing and
                  thrice as real. But this was a time of testing for which I had no strength. There
                  came a moment on the day preceding the party when, black guilt on my soul, I
                  decided to break the stern commandment. I actually opened mamma’s bureau
                  drawer!</p>
               <p>If my heart sank in sore disappointment over what I then
                  discovered, I quickly acknowledged that I probably deserved it. I had been very,
                  very wicked, and wickedness brought its own reward. What I discovered was a huge
                  doll, dressed in a marvellous creation of old rose and yellow silk. Yes, there,
                  before my guilty eyes lay the treasure my mother had been creating. A doll!</p>
               <p>How little I wanted a doll! I had hoped it was a dress, or even a
                  new pinafore—but a doll! With tears of mortification and shame streaking my face,
                  I fled back to my corner. Oh, how was I to meet the horrible experience that
                  awaited me? Mamma would expect me to be so thrilled. And at the moment it seemed
                  to me I should never be happy again. Dolls were such stupid things. I had no
                  mothering instincts whatsoever. Never, in my entire childhood, did the game of
                  motherhood enter my head. I had squads of paper dolls, it is true, but these were
                  amenable personages. Sometimes they were a congregation, harangued by a fat brown
                  fellow who reminded me of a country preacher I had seen. Sometimes they formed a
                  company headed for adventure. They were, in fact, characters that acted out my
                  fluent tales. They were people, and I loved them, but what was I to do with a huge
                  yellow-headed thing of sawdust and porcelain?</p>
               <p>Another horrid thought assailed me. Mother might expect me to keep
                  the creature in the little wicker carriage I had received last Christmas. That
                  would be the end of everything. Almost since the beginning it had served as a bed
                  for my two cats. They had been dear, fluffy kittens when it arrived, and had
                  quickly learned to sleep stretched out like little gentlemen, each on his pillow,
                  one at the foot, the other at the head. Now much too large to share the coveted
                  bed, they fought for its possession, the victor still taking his siesta stretched
                  full length and purring loudly. Cats were the joy of my life. I loved them for
                  their grace and independence. I respected them because they brooked no discourtesy
                  and gave their affection only where it was deserved. They were my unfailing
                  confidants, and I never doubted they understood me, and thoroughly appreciated the
                  yarns I spun for them.</p>
               <p>One of the cats seemed especially addicted to solemn philosophy. He
                  used to sit at my knees, his green eyes fixed on the middle distance, and purr in
                  a professional rumble as I gabbled on. ‘Yes, yes, that’s a likely tale, my child,’
                  he seemed to be purring, ‘but oh, what glamorous mysteries my inner vision
                  beholds, to which you, poor dear, are blind as the blindest mouse!’</p>
               <p>Naturally, it was to Gráni I now poured out my woeful
                  confession.</p>
               <p>‘I have been very, very bad,’ I told him, rubbing his elastic back.
                  ‘I have been snooping in mamma’s bureau—a thing even papa hesitates to do. And
                  what did I get for my courage, do you suppose? A doll! A stiff, wretched
                  doll!’</p>
               <p>Next morning I slept late, and was wakened by the entrance of mamma
                  and a woman friend who was helping with the party. They came in smiling, and
                  mamma, bending to kiss me, said, ‘God bless you, dear, on this and every
                  birthday.’ Then, with tender pride, she brought from behind her back the big
                  blonde doll in all its silken splendour. It was the moment I never forgot. I was
                  so utterly ashamed I could only gaze at her speechless. Which fetched the coals
                  upon my head. With the happiest expression, mamma turned to her friend.</p>
               <p>‘Bless her little heart—she’s absolutely overcome!’ she said. ‘Dear
                  little soul—she never had a pretty doll before.’</p>
               <p>What a worm I felt. How dearly I should have loved to confess and
                  cry out my wickedness. Instead, I hugged the beastly doll, and stupidly blinked my
                  eyes. No doubt I looked a stolid simpleton. I was so often accused of letting the
                  cat get my tongue that I have no doubt whatever that my queer silences were
                  usually interpreted as a lack of intelligence. I sometimes think I must have been
                  rather stupid in those years of recurrent illness. I remember so little of the
                  actual daily happening around me, and yet I was always acutely aware of moods, and
                  while I sat so stolidly in my place I never missed a single oddity of behaviour in
                  the occasional visitor. Voices, gestures, a colourful phrase even though
                  meaningless at the time, these stayed with me. So, too, I might be in the grip of
                  some undefined emotion, and, like the wind out of a clear sky, thoughts undreamed
                  before would swoop across my mind. So now I suddenly perceived with incontestable
                  reason that truthfulness was not always a virtue. I could not now hurt mamma’s
                  feelings just to give myself the relief of confessing what I had done and how
                  mistaken she was in her good intentions. Mamma was a great stickler for truth, for
                  speaking her mind, and not giving any false impressions. Just the same, I knew now
                  what papa meant when he argued that kindness was much more important than the
                  conceits of a Puritan conscience. Not, of course, that I put it to myself in those
                  words. I just decided that I would do as papa often did—say nothing, and let truth
                  take care of itself.</p>
               <p>How I scowled at that yellow-headed doll when the women moved off,
                  cheerfully satisfied, as adults generally were with all their mistaken efforts on
                  behalf of children. How I hated the smiling beauty. How disgusted I was to have to
                  parade it as my dear treasure before the guests that night. Truly a time of
                  hemlock retribution. Still, truth compels me to admit that everything was not gall
                  and wormwood. In fact, delicious excitement triumphed so soon as the odious
                  courtesy was off my mind. So many little gifts were showered upon me—even a bright
                  new dollar, which I was permitted to hold for a minute or two. Later it would go
                  for cod-liver oil, but now it was mine, and how rich I felt. Indeed, everything
                  went off remarkably well, until Mrs. Swainson, mamma’s best friend, brought her
                  young son Johnny, who, quaking but obedient, handed me a mysterious package. Now,
                  Johnny was a very nice boy, for whom I had a deep, though secret affection. He was
                  almost as easy to play with as Gráni, my cat. We were really the best of
                  companions, and therefore understood that our attachment was not to be flaunted
                  under adult noses. Yet, here he was, made to hand me this gift, with every one
                  looking on, and I must open the package. When the paper came off, my eyes nearly
                  popped out of my head. Dear me! here was a treasure. I simply couldn’t credit my
                  vision. Think of it! There on the rustly paper lay a silver-plated belt such as
                  Icelandic women wear on their national dress, and it was set with my blue birth
                  stones.</p>
               <p>‘Now, picture that!’ a laughing voice exclaimed. ‘The little lover
                  brings his dear the bridal belt. Now, surely he gets a kiss for it!’</p>
               <p>Gracious goodness! Kiss Johnny—kiss my good friend! Frantically my
                  glances swept the grown-up faces. Oh, were such fools ever! How could they ask me
                  to do such a thing to a decent little boy! I did not have to look at Johnny to
                  know how horrified he was—how he would hate me if I let him be thus humiliated. A
                  stout female with a determined expression edged closer. I did not wait for the
                  mischief I knew she contemplated. With a muffled squeal, I bolted from the scene.
                  Laughter pursued me, horrid peals of merriment that brought a nervous dew out on
                  my skin.</p>
               <p>Thanks to mamma, who, at that moment, announced that the table was
                  spread, I got away. With no thought to the fine feast I was missing, I tore up the
                  stairs, my one conscious desire to hide away for ever. Mamma’s room had a big
                  closet, and I would creep into that, I thought, and then it occurred to me that
                  such an obvious place was worse than none. There was no other hiding-place—but
                  wait! There was! After all, I wasn’t very big, and that old-fashioned washstand of
                  mamma’s stood waist high. I could easily squeeze into that.</p>
               <p>When I wrenched open the double doors, I saw something that so
                  astonished me and enthralled me that every fear fled. It was a blue paper box,
                  parading four full rows of fat chocolate pigs with beautiful pink eyes! No need to
                  tell me whose gift this was. Only papa would have thought of such a delightfully
                  useless present. Why, I didn’t even eat candy. I could play with my darling fat
                  pigs, and in due course give each away as the sacrificial spirit moved me. I was
                  so thrilled at the rosy prospect that I forgot Johnny. I forgot the party I was
                  missing. I just sat there in utter bliss, twelve pink-eyed porkers on the floor
                  before me, happy as a herdsman on a sunny hill, when papa himself came to find me.
                  ‘Dear me, whatever have you there?’ said he, his eyes twinkling. ‘Now, why should
                  any one give sweets to a child that doesn’t eat them?’</p>
               <p>‘Because that’s why!’ I shouted. And, somehow, we perfectly
                  understood each other.</p>
               <p>There was another time when papa turned disappointment to joy. It
                  was Christmas, and mamma, still convinced that her birthday gift had been a huge
                  success, gave me two little dolls—one dressed in the Icelandic national costume,
                  the other like a sailor. As often happened, she was much too busy to notice my
                  lack of enthusiasm. Anyway, she had taken such pains with the little dress, how
                  could any child be other than pleased? And now she was making the Christmas
                  chocolate. My sister Anna was there, now a pretty teen-age girl who sang in the
                  church choir and seemed to me a paragon of all the maidenly graces. She had
                  brought her guitar, and very likely would sing a duet with brother Minty in the
                  course of the evening. Every one was very gay, and made a fuss over my novel
                  presents. And no wonder, for the little dolls had each a tiny chair with a real
                  plush bottom! Yet I hung about with a sober face, saying nothing whatsoever.</p>
               <p>‘Well! Well!’ papa suddenly exclaimed. ‘I don’t wonder you look
                  thoughtful, Lalla. A bride and groom on your hands, without a moment’s warning.
                  Now, what do you say to a wedding?’</p>
               <p>‘A wedding! But, papa—what to do for a minister?’ I queried, eager
                  enough, now that a game was to be played.</p>
               <p>‘Tut tut! Fetch my frock coat, and you shall see,’ papa answered.
                  Sure enough, when he had donned the old Prince Albert and set his face in a
                  serious mould, papa might easily have passed for ‘His Reverence’. Unless, of
                  course, you caught the sly twinkle in his eye. But the dolls never guessed. Very
                  eloquently, he read them the marriage service, with every one gathered round, and
                  when all was done mamma’s Christmas chocolate did double service. We toasted the
                  bridal pair in the first cup, and drank the second to celebrate a happy Icelandic
                     Jule.</p>
               <p>It was all very jolly. The dolls were set on a shelf near the
                  little tree, and when we had sampled every one of mamma’s culinary marvels, we
                  drew up our chairs in a ring while papa lighted the candles. The coal-oil lamp was
                  dimmed and while the little golden flames leaped and flickered upon the sweet
                  green branches, we sang the old old songs of the dear Christ Child and his holy
                  maiden mother. And, sitting there in utter quietness, mamma’s face was somehow
                  changed—as though in this moment of blessed peace all the tenderness she hid in
                  her heart were shining through the flesh. I should like to have told her how
                  radiant she seemed, but for that I had no words. I could only cling to her hand
                  when she came, that night, as always, to wish me good rest, to say, with old-world
                  grace: ‘God grant you good night!’</p>

               <head>Tales Strange and Varied</head>
               <p>It is undoubtedly true that human perceptions are not only widely
                  different in their accuracy and acuteness, but that even in the case of each
                  individual the growing awareness of the world is far from being an orderly process
                  of development. In my own case, for instance, I seem to have been relatively
                  untouched by the daily bustle round me, forming no faintest idea of even the most
                  commonplace happenings, whereas I was always peculiarly sensitive to varying
                  moods, and read into gestures and the odd high-sounding phrase all manner of
                  provocative meanings and possibilities. Which is only to say that, so far as my
                  fundamental characteristics were concerned, I was potentially a true Icelander.
                  For the Icelander, tempered by centuries of cataclysmic disasters that have taught
                  him the impermanence and inadequacy of material possessions, is more likely to be
                  keenly engrossed with problems of time than of space. The ancient Norsemen set
                  great store by pomp and circumstance, like the Greeks, to whose classics the sagas
                  are comparable, they delighted in physical prowess and beauty, in everything that
                  pleasured the five senses. But, as time rolled on and all these things were
                  senselessly destroyed by senseless nature, their descendants came by degrees to
                  fix the quest of their restless souls on imperishable concepts. Less and less they
                  coveted and prized externals, and embraced instead beauties of the mind and
                  heart.</p>
               <p>This, I suppose, is the reason why so many Icelanders of the older
                  generation were seemingly oblivious of their lack of trimness and taste in their
                  houses, although they might discourse with understanding and deep insight on the
                  elegance of literature and philosophy. As a matter of fact, most foreign visitors
                  to Iceland find it necessary to comment upon what strikes them as most singular:
                  that not infrequently some uncouth-looking farmer whose entire days have been
                  spent in the fields, has, upon the least encouragement, launched into an animated
                  discussion of subjects of this kind. The simple explanation is, of course, that
                  the Icelander prizes intellect as other nations prize money, and that his true
                  solace lies in spiritual abstractions. Consequently, he is not religious in the
                  conventional sense, for religion is rooted in materialism. In its final analysis,
                  it is a doctrine of me and mine, a sanctifier of property, patriotism, and war,
                  and its ultimate glory is a triumphant entry into paradise. Perverse though it may
                  seem, the thinking Icelander has, whether he knows it or not, reverted to the old
                  common sense of his Viking ancestors, whose gods were merely symbols of abstract
                  qualities, and to whom the creative force of the universe remained the Nameless
                  One, unconditioned by time and space. In this scientific day the terminology has
                  changed, but the idea is the same. The old Vikings spoke of death as a passing to
                  ‘The Other Light’. The modern Icelander thinks of dissolution as a return to the
                  elements. And, in both instances, the obvious, the tangible, and concrete were
                  recognized for what they are—perishable symbols of an imperishable power flowing
                  on towards some dim, undivined fruition. For which reason, causes, rather than
                  acts, engage our interests, and our standard of values is based upon lasting
                  reality. No doubt these pleasant conceits will be wiped out of us in this
                  enlightened country, Canada, where everything from a baby’s bonnet to a literary
                  masterpiece is conscientiously gauged by dollars and cents. But, as yet, those of
                  us who were conditioned in old-fashioned homes cling to the delusion that what a
                  man has is of less importance than what he is. For, say we, in the height of our
                  folly, it is even conceivable that an unfortuitous series of circumstances might
                  annihilate one or all of the Ford plants, but less likely that Mr. Ford himself
                  should be knocked on the head. Moreover, we are hideously sceptical of any art
                  which is worn like a mental bustle to lend a bump of importance to an otherwise
                  undeveloped space.</p>
               <p>That I was a victim of that sort of conditioning there seems no
                  doubt. Even as a child I was bored with the familiar and commonplace, and sought
                  to escape into a weird world of fabulous imaginings. Because I could not attend
                  school for reasons of ill health, this silly habit of dreaming became a sort of
                  obsession, so that I walked about with my head full of imaginary people, whose
                  perplexities and peccadillos became my own. I talked to myself in several voices,
                  and argued at length the destinies of hypothetical sprites and spirits. When, on
                  rare occasions, I enjoyed a real companion, I naturally tyrannized the show, for
                  how could I play like other children when I had never been permitted to risk my
                  precious skin in such happy pastimes? But if I knew nothing about
                  pom-pom-pullaway, drop-the-hand-kerchief, and puss-in-the-corner, I could quickly
                  improvise a dramatic situation with nothing better than a shawl, some chairs, and
                  a pillow or two. I could walk about, imitating the wrath of God slaying the
                  Egyptians, or, less thrilling, adopt the dignified mien of the good old
                  homoeopathic doctor, and save, one by one, the suffering pillows from the vapours,
                  biliousness, and lumbago.</p>
               <p>There was nothing particularly clever or remarkable in these
                  fabrications, but they served me well as an antidote for boredom on those sunny
                  days when I must watch the antics of happier children from the prison square of my
                  window. If my immediate world was confined to cough syrups, mustard plasters, and
                  turnip soup, I could, at least, forswear these horrors in the jealous kingdom of
                  my imagination.</p>
               <p>So, too, if adult conversation centred upon sickness, struggles,
                  and want, I drew back into my shell of cultivated inattention. Yet, so soon as the
                  topic swerved to less familiar subjects, my ears were keen enough. I recall one
                  hushed conversation to which I should have been deaf. A flibbertigibbet woman had
                  deserted her two-year-old son and a husband who adored her, to run off with a
                  scallawag paramour.</p>
               <p>‘He just a smooth-tongued wastrel!’ exclaimed our informer,
                  unctuously. ‘An unholy rascal! The wretched woman has no sense at all—the soulless
                  wench. To desert her own child—Herra Gud! If that were the
                  end—what’s to become of the little——’ and she crossed her arms over an ample
                  bosom, rocking to and fro, developing suspense with unconscious delight, while
                  mamma, coffee-pot in hand, waited for the conclusion.</p>
               <p>‘Ja, ja,’ sighed my parent, sympathetic but impatient. ‘Out with
                  it, Kristine. What has the poor man done, for I take it that’s what you’re coming
                  to?’</p>
               <p>Kristine groaned, her eyes accusative and wet. ‘Ha! What could he
                  have done, God rest him, loving that frivolous creature, as men will, the fools!
                  Yes, what? What, but died of a broken heart!’</p>
               <p>This final bit of acting was so mournfully sepulchral that the
                  flesh wriggled on my bones and my stomach hitched itself into a hard knot under my
                  breastbone. To die of a broken heart, I at once perceived, was indeed a terrible
                  business, and the cause of it no better than a Jezebel. For our visitor further
                  related how the maddened husband, in the dead of night, had wandered into the
                  vicinity of the hospital and shot himself. ‘And his brains scattered on the common
                  walk!’ sobbed Kristine, between bites of doughnut. ‘You may call it death by a
                  bullet,’ said she, ‘or suicide, more like, but that’s not what the Day of
                  Judgement will call it!’</p>
               <p>Sure, and even I could guess that much! It was the flibbertigibbet
                  wench killed him. Long after my bedtime I lay awake, with a hand to my breast,
                  trying to suffer, as that poor man had suffered, speculatively awaiting the first
                  indications of an acute internal eruption certain to end in a broken heart.</p>
               <p>Thereafter, I used to watch women on the street, trying to
                  distinguish the incipient Jezebel from her commonplace sisters, the light hussy
                  from sensible females who trundled babies and trailed their voluminous alpaca
                  skirts in the mud. I fared rather badly at the game, however, for the drabness of
                  our neighbourhood was only surpassed by its virtue, and even my tolerant
                  imagination balked at attributing glamour to the straight-haired, firmly corsetted
                  females who billowed by. Yet, fortunately for my weavings, our house was a centre
                  for all sorts of odd characters. Some one was always popping in from the country,
                  or near-by villages, with tales strange and varied.</p>
               <p>There was Rosa, for instance. A pretty Icelandic girl, so the tale
                  went, but giddy in the head. So giddy, in fact, that she took up with a
                  Frenchman—and he a Roman Catholic. Yes indeed! The silly girl met him at a picnic,
                  and proceeded to beguile him to such an extent that, by New Year’s Day, he was
                  ready, and even eager, to take part in the Elf Dance. Now, as every one knows, the
                  Elf Dance should be conducted by intimates and lovers, for the Little People are
                  most particular that way. Their morals are shocked by frivolities of the heart.
                  Besides, it is undoubtedly a pretty sight when sweethearts, arms linked, and
                  lighted candles in their hands, go dancing down a frozen stream on the peal of
                  midnight. For, as you must guess, the stars are then reflected in smiling youthful
                  eyes, and the greetings they shout to the Little People are as warm and sincere as
                  their heart’s devotion.</p>
               <p>Dear me! Poor Rosa seems to have thought more of showing off her
                  paces and a new red bonnet than of the custom itself, or of the consequences of
                  wheeling through the starlight with a romantic Frenchman by her side. So, of
                  course, they fell in love, but under the ban of the offended Little People. Which
                  may, or may not explain the blight that fell upon them. For, can you believe it,
                  when little Rosa, red as a peony, and simpering like an infant brook, told her
                  papa the glorious news, the good man was horrified. Never, in his wildest
                  nightmares, had he suffered such a shock! A Frenchman, and an idolater! Why, he
                  refused point-blank to give the creature house-room, let alone his daughter. Nor
                  was Pierre’s mamma one whit better. Passionately, she implored the saints to
                  strike her dead if ever she consented to such a preposterous union.</p>
               <p>Goodness me, how the Little People must have snickered up their
                  sleeves, as the mischief grew from bad to worse. Never dreaming that boastful
                  mortals, who aspire to vanquish the earth and rule the seven heavens, wouldn’t
                  find a happy solution for a little problem in random love. But there it was: the
                  old folks thundered, and the young folks sulked. When flesh could bear no more,
                  Rosa stole into the fields to weep on Pierre’s shoulder, and he, poor lad, shaken
                  to the marrow, threatened heaven and earth—but not mamma.</p>
               <p>Of piety and paprika there can be too much. Poor Pierre was
                  seasoned too highly to withstand the boilings and bubbling of carnal passions. He
                  hanged himself in the cowshed. ‘Oh well, virtue is its own reward,’ papa commented
                  dryly, and added, ‘That pious old beldam should be satisfied—her son chose
                  Purgatory, rather than bliss with a heretic!’</p>
               <p>As for Rosa, softly fashioned for a man’s arms, and unburdened with
                  brains, she took the blow philosophically. To be sure, she wept for a week, and
                  wore a black ribbon on her sleeve for the rest of the season; but in the fall she
                  cheerfully married a gentleman who possessed a good team of oxen, a quarter
                  section of ploughed land, three cows, and her parents’ admiration was unbounded
                  because he played the harmonica and was a God-fearing Lutheran.</p>
               <p>There were other tales, no less interesting, though without
                  romantic connotations. Tales of quiet heroism, enacted by quite ordinary people.
                  Gimli pioneers were fond of telling how a certain farmer, with little to commend
                  him by way of concrete accomplishments, had, none the less, saved his daughter’s
                  life by a spectacular feat of endurance. The family lived near Sandy Bar, isolated
                  from neighbours, and, even when the lake froze over, it was an arduous trip to
                  Gimli if the snowfall was heavy, or the winds raging. But when the child was
                  stricken with high fever and symptoms terrifying to the parents, the lake was far
                  from safe. Yet the father set out in the teeth of the storm, determined to make
                  the passage. He was a famous sprinter, and, in his speed, half-blinded by the snow
                  that clung like frozen tears to his eyes, he fell into a wide fissure. Weighted
                  with heavy clothes and cowhide boots, he thrashed about in the water, dodging
                  moving ice, and finally, when almost prostrate, reached safety on the other side.
                  By the time he reached the doctor’s house, he was literally armoured in ice that
                  had to be chipped from his clothing.</p>
               <p>The doctor admired his courage, but not to the point of emulating
                  such a crazy venture. He prescribed for the child to the best of his ability,
                  furnished the required medicines, and with that the father was well content. For
                  it meant he could return more swiftly, unhampered by a stoutish gentleman with no
                  taste for berserk exploits. Nor would he wait for the dawn. Not he! A quart of
                  coffee and a shot of rum were all the support he needed.</p>
               <p>It is pleasant to know that the small daughter recovered, and that
                  her father’s devotion became a tale told with honest wonder for the edification of
                  a softer, sophisticated second generation.</p>
               <p>The laurels were not always for the sterner sex. There was
                  Great-Aunt Steinun, as brave a little lady as ever faced the wilderness. She came
                  to Canada in the first immigration, as we called it. That is to say, with that
                  group of twelve hundred settlers who arrived in 1872, destined for the Gimli and
                  Icelandic River settlements. Through the negligence of the immigration officials
                  in Montreal, these poor, weary home-seekers were made to spend the night in
                  quarters that had housed some Indians polluted with small-pox. Consequently, the
                  immigrants had barely reached their destination when the plague broke out. And,
                  for eighteen months, homeless and helpless, without medical supervision, they were
                  quarantined in the swamps of Gimli.</p>
               <p>Now that Gimli has become a favourite summer resort, with railway
                  flier service to Winnipeg, it is difficult to conceive of a time when all the
                  surrounding country was a fly-infested quagmire, through which, in rainy seasons,
                  you had to wade knee-high. Homesteads were often under water for weeks in the
                  spring, the wretched inmates clinging to the damp shelter of their miserable log
                  huts until the water invaded the fire-box of the stove, thereby routing the last
                  shreds of comfort.</p>
               <p>Great-Aunt Steinun’s first shelter in Gimli was a roofless log
                  enclosure, so full of water that her husband had to build a raft on which to lay
                  their beds. A foolish sort of arrangement, you may think, but, to quote the little
                  lady: ‘It broke the October winds and kept us from floating all over the
                  field.’</p>
               <p>In such surroundings, the travel-worn immigrants had to meet and
                  suffer the horrors of small-pox, alternating their labours of burying the dead
                  with felling green timber for huts to house the living. Great-Aunt Steinun, though
                  fond enough of reminiscing, did not like to dwell on the epidemic. It was too
                  painful to think of the sodden graves that marked the end of so many fair
                  hopes—and more painful still to remember that one hundred and twenty-five babies
                  literally died of starvation. Poor innocents! How desperately their mothers tried
                  to keep them alive on fish broth and bean stock, the only substitutes available
                  for the milk which could not be had. The Government had intended to supply the
                  settlers with cattle, but all such worthy plans were disrupted and long delayed by
                  the raging pestilence. It was hard enough to get staple foods to the people, to
                  say nothing of livestock and luxuries. Every few weeks the Mounted Police rode up
                  to a specified zone with rations of salt pork, and beans, food the Icelanders had
                  never before tasted, and, consequently, found indigestible fare in their enfeebled
                  condition.</p>
               <p>Terrible though these trials were, the sorest weight upon
                  great-aunt’s heart was the uncertainty concerning her eldest daughter. This girl,
                  about fourteen years old, had been sent into service by the immigration
                  authorities, it being their thought she was well able to support herself in the
                  city. In the general confusion of settling so many people, they had, however,
                  omitted to leave the girl’s address with her parents, and when the plague set in
                  it was, of course, impossible to communicate this or any other information to the
                  immigrants. During all those frightful months, Great-Aunt Steinun was haunted by
                  the thought that this dearest of her children might have contracted the disease,
                  and perhaps died among strangers indifferent to her suffering and loneliness. Nor
                  was she relieved of this worry when the quarantine was lifted. By that time no one
                  in the immigration bureau even remembered the girl, and it was not until three
                  years later that the family was reunited.</p>
               <p>What I like best to remember about Great-Aunt Steinun, however, has
                  to do with an incident which, to my mind, surpasses all others in her hard
                  experience and throws a revealing light upon her forceful character. It happened
                  that, while raising his permanent house Mr. Haldorson, her husband, cut his foot
                  rather badly, yet continued his labour, giving slight heed to the wound. An
                  infection set in, which, as the days passed, grew steadily worse, until it was no
                  longer possible for him to keep on his feet, and, as the fever mounted, it was
                  obvious that his condition was rapidly becoming critical. Their homestead, like so
                  many others, was isolated, far from any neighbour. They had no means of
                  conveyance, no draft beast of any kind, and Winnipeg was sixty miles away.</p>
               <p>Great-Aunt Steinun was not the sort of woman to sit weeping,
                  waiting for some miracle of grace. What they did possess was a crude hand sleigh
                  for hauling wood. Her mind made up, she poured water on the wooden runners,
                  affixed a rude harness, and, overruling Mr. Haldorson’s dismayed objections,
                  pronounced herself ready to take him to Winnipeg. But when the sick man had been
                  made as comfortable as the means permitted, Steinun was momentarily
                  panic-stricken. She realized suddenly that she had not the slightest idea, beyond
                  an indefinite direction, how to reach Winnipeg. Her husband was no better
                  informed. They had only made the journey once before, in the company of the other
                  immigrants. Besides, the poor man by now was half delirious with fever.</p>
               <p>‘I thought for a moment that no one had ever been left so
                  helpless,’ she used to say. ‘Then I was ashamed of myself. What was the good of
                  having a God you wouldn’t trust as well as your neighbour, I asked myself? So then
                  and there I started, and, at the edge of the lake, put it up to the Almighty.
                  Whatever thought He put in my head, I would take for guidance. And that’s what I
                  did.’</p>
               <p>There, according to Great-Aunt Steinun, the tale rightly ended, for
                  she was always loath to delineate personal hardships. Sometimes, however,
                  especially if the listener were sceptical of divine provision, she might supply
                  the remaining details. Drawing that cumbrous sleigh, with its human burden, was in
                  itself a task beyond the normal strength of a little woman scarcely five feet
                  tall, worn with vigils over the sick and dying, and in all probability
                  under-nourished. Yet she trekked on bravely, over the lonely waste of ice, only
                  pausing to rest when the heavy pounding of her heart made her dizzy. Hours later,
                  a wind sprang up, with driving puffs of snow—not the gentle flakes of a milder
                  climate, but the dry, powdered concomitant of a gathering blizzard. No one who has
                  not experienced this phenomenon of the prairie can possibly imagine how quickly a
                  peaceful landscape is changed to an inferno of lashing wind and whirling clouds of
                  snow that sting the eyes and stifle the breath, and obliterate every familiar
                  object.</p>
               <p>‘Oh, it was a bit of a struggle, to be sure,’ she admitted. ‘What
                  of it? I had put myself in God’s care. Humanly speaking, I was lost, I suppose,
                  and the strength flowing out of me like water from a cracked crock. But again,
                  what of that? Before I was overcome, an Indian found us, and took us home to his
                  tepee.</p>
               <p>‘That was a lesson, let me tell you. The young squaw massaged my
                  frozen feet with a mixture of bear’s grease and some sort of herb. She fed us from
                  the family pot, and, before I set out once more, dressed me in deerskin leggings
                  and moccasins lined with moss. Ah, they were good, those two brown people. They
                  shared all they had with us and when the storm was over that fierce-looking brave
                  saw me off on the right trail. So you see if my husband was saved, it was not all
                  my doing, but a miracle of God’s mercy, working through the simple heart of a
                  savage.’</p>
               <p>Sometimes these homespun yarns had a humorous twist, even when the
                  undertones were sober. I remember the hair-raising experience of an old charwoman
                  whom the young wags loved to terrorize with tall tales of Indian atrocities. She
                  lived alone in a tiny shanty on Point Douglas, and though her days were devoted to
                  monotonous labour she was always exuberant in praise of her many blessings. Had
                  she not a cosy shelter for her old bones, food in the larder, and good Manitoba
                  spruce cut to fit her carron stove laid in against the winter? What was more, had
                  not the blessed Lord given her a knack with the little ones, and more than enough
                  strength and patience to struggle with spotted linen and pine boards, so that,
                  whatever the ladies in their big houses required of her, it was always well and
                  respectably done, and she paid with a cheery heart that often expressed itself in
                  a cast-off petticoat or a queerish bonnet, in addition to wages? Blessed she
                  certainly was, and, except for that menace of redskins, found the New World all
                  that one might have expected, since the good God made it.</p>
               <p>There came a chill October evening when this fixed obsession was
                  especially rampant. It was cold, with flurries of snow, and shadows long and black
                  on the river bank. A night for evil deeds, thought poor old Ellen, and quickened
                  her stride, despite the crick in her back. On such a night it was good to have a
                  secure shelter, a bit of a place that kept one safe from savage eyes. The sight of
                  her tar-paper shack, hidden in a windbreak of ragged poplars, drew a sigh of
                  happiness from her heart. In no time at all she would be toasting her toes by the
                  stove, and the cat purring his gladness.</p>
               <p>She was an orderly soul, and always laid the fire before she went
                  to work in the morning. She had only to drop a match on the kindling to start a
                  cheery blaze, light the wall lamp, and set the kettle on for coffee. This done,
                  she usually called the cat, removing her wraps while Thomas took his time
                  responding, and then shut and barred the door for the night. But now, chilled and
                  blue from the biting wind, she thought of the woodbox, and frowned to discover
                  that she had forgotten to fill it. Well, thought Ellen, that’s what comes of
                  sleeping in for fifteen minutes! Now she must fetch and carry, though nineteen
                  devils plagued her back. Grumbling, she flung wide the door, ‘Thomas’ framed on
                  her tongue, but neither that nor any other sound came from her lips. As stricken
                  as Lot’s sinful wife, she stood there, her horrified eyes fixed upon the road. God
                  and his angels help her! Plain as the nose on her face, the doom she dreaded
                  marched upon her. Three dusky, buckskinned knaves were striding towards the house,
                  snow whirling round their horrid heads, a long lean hound loping at their heels.
                  She was so frightened, so certain of the inevitable end, that it never occurred to
                  her that she might shut the door, and, by this simple act, escape an unwelcome
                  visitation. Instead, she stood there, too petrified for speech, while the
                  strangers, who, politely enough, asked for shelter, filed in, and with grunts of
                  satisfaction seated themselves on the bench before the table. Evidently they
                  wanted food, as well as shelter, thought the old woman, dim stirrings of rising
                  anger minimizing her fear. The scallawags! Why didn’t they kill her and be done?
                  Why must they prolong the agony, the murdering villains! She supposed they would
                  scalp her as a matter of course, for she had long, yellow hair. Just the sort of
                  hair braves love to dangle from their belts, so the wags had assured her. Just the
                  same, there they sat, hungrily, eyeing the kettle. Well, thought Ellen, gathering
                  what wit she had, and hurrying to the cupboard, if she must so shortly meet her
                  Maker, she might as well do it without the sin of inhospitality on her soul. As
                  glumly silent as her company, she laid the supper, which was eaten in typical
                  Indian stolidity, and at its conclusion the trio plunged down upon the floor,
                  prepared to sleep. Even the hound had dropped in a weary loop before the glowing
                  stove.</p>
               <p>Ellen was now completely mystified. Was it possible she had
                  misjudged the wanderers? Or were they, perchance, waiting some prescribed
                  ritualistic hour for their evil purpose? Whatever their designs, she had not the
                  heart to let them lie on the cold, bare boards uncovered. Gingerly, she crossed
                  behind the human huddle, and from an old wooden trunk fetched two patchwork quilts
                  for their comfort. A grunt, thoroughly unnerving, was all the thanks she
                  received.</p>
               <p>There was nothing more that could be done. She dared not even call
                  the cat. Poor Thomas must take his ease where he found it. Grieved for her pet,
                  whose place was usurped by a smelly mongrel, she restocked the fire, and, musing
                  upon the uncertainty of life, decided that she might as well snatch a wink of
                  sleep to support her through the ordeal to come. With shaking fingers she removed
                  the lamp from its bracket and bore it to the home-made table beside the bed, which
                  occupied the far corner, and was neatly dressed in a cretonne cover and long,
                  frilled valance. Being a modest female, she naturally meant to lie down fully
                  clothed, howsoever her stays pinched. But the fine spread and valance must be
                  removed. This done, she lay down, and then, the breath rattling in her throat,
                  cautiously leaned out and extinguished the light.</p>
               <p>Almost instantly hell broke loose. With a savage scraping of nails
                  upon the floor, and hair-raising snarls from a cavernous chest, the great hound
                  came hurtling across the room and dived under the bed. The sleepers sprang to
                  their feet. Some one relit the lamp. Then, to the quaking woman, it seemed that
                  men and dog were inextricably mixed in a heaving, howling mêlée. A nightmare of fury too swift to follow or comprehend, until the din
                  of battle died away, and there was stamped upon her mind the ineradicable vision
                  of a hulking negro who had been dragged from under her bed, and now hung limply in
                  the iron grasp of the Metis.</p>
               <p>Thereupon, realizing the miracle of her deliverance, poor old Ellen
                  promptly fainted. When she regained consciousness the house was sheathed in
                  silence. The red eye of the stove blinked beneficently through the dusk. The dog
                  breathed like a cheerful bellows, and the angels she had entertained unaware
                  snored in solid comfort.</p>
               <p>Oh, but she was sore ashamed! Never again would she believe those
                  tales of evil—never, never! In the morning she would open a jar of strawberry jam
                  and fry a batch of flatbread. Other things as well she planned, and, in the midst
                  of it, fell sound asleep—for fear may reign an hour, but old bones require rest.
                  When she wakened the fire was crackling, and the kettle sang, and the bright
                  prairie sunshine was a sunburst of joy on the window-pane. What happiness it now
                  was to hustle up the meal. How glad she was that her bit of cooking was always a
                  matter of pride—her flatbread golden-brown, and her tea hot and fragrant.</p>
               <p>This morning she would have welcomed a little chatter to open the
                  way for the question that burned her mind. But the visitors ate all that was set
                  before them in unbroken silence. Not a murmur out of any of them. Not a single
                  reference to the terrible incident of the night before. They behaved just as
                  though nothing out of the ordinary had happened—just as though they had not saved
                  her life.</p>
               <p>Not until they were leaving was a word spoken, and then it was an
                  irrelevant question, flung out with a sudden dazzling smile by the youngest of the
                  trio.</p>
               <p>‘You like moose meat?’ he asked. Yes, yes, she did, Ellen
                  acknowledged. ‘Good,’ said he, and the others nodded. They would bring her some on
                  their way back from the north.</p>
               <p>‘But—but——’ stammered Ellen, ‘I want to know—I’ve got to know——’
                  And there words failed her.</p>
               <p>It was then that the nut-brown ancient whose wrinkled face had
                  struck the deepest terror to Ellen’s heart spoke for the first time. Drawing
                  himself up to his full, fine height, and swinging his arm in a majestic curve
                  toward the Red River, he said, with proud finality:</p>
               <p>‘Heap much gone hell!’</p>
               <p>As I think of it now, it seems to me that, despite the general
                  hardship of our existence in those vanished days, life itself supplied us with
                  sufficient interesting drama. We were rich in characters. It was not so important
                  then as now for every one to be as like his neighbour as two rabbits in a
                  taxidermist’s window. Even quite fine ladies went in for a little mild
                  eccentricities. They strove for the unique, rather than the popular, and prided
                  themselves on certain delicate, cultured reactions. As a rule, these ethical
                  distinctions were a challenge to the flesh and the devil. One virtuous female, for
                  instance, went about in nine petticoats. Another boasted, discreetly, of course,
                  that never, in the entire course of her married life, had she disrobed in the
                  light! This was the more remarkable, since the lady was reasonably good to look
                  upon. Another good woman saved the morals of the neighbourhood by hanging her
                  personal wear in a shed, out of sight. These excellent creatures were, in their
                  own opinion, delicacy personified, and had the same claim to virtue as the good
                  Queen, who still graced the throne of England. Indeed, they fainted at the least
                  hint of coarseness, and, upon occasion, had to be helped from the meeting-house if
                  the Pastor chose too sulphuric a topic. This was always a telling act if an
                  attractive male happened to be near. Next to the dainty swoon, poetry was a
                  genuine asset to any unattached female. An enduring asset, I might add, for, years
                  later, when my small world had been greatly extended, I met a pathetically plain
                  spinster who recited ‘The Sonnets From the Portuguese’ with such passionate
                  abandon as would certainly have annihilated poor ‘Ba’. The poor old girl was an
                  exponent of culture, garbed herself in grey and leaf-brown, and never, under any
                  circumstances, clipped her words like the abominable barbarians across the border.
                  Commonplace as a sparrow, she was fond of quoting that beauty is only skin deep,
                  and swatted every attempted argument on the social inequalities by murmuring that
                  God was in His heaven, and all was right with the world.</p>
               <p>But, in those older days, there were ladies of equally fixed
                  principles who were gifted with sufficient genius to inflict their preferences
                  upon less admirable mortals. Such a one was old Rebecca. Her fetish was
                  temperance, and her affliction a wayward spouse. Reason failing to cure the
                  culprit, she sewed him up in bedsheets, administered a sound whipping, and
                  promised a similar correction upon all or any occasion when his pleasant vice
                  reduced him to helpless slumber. What was more, if he misbehaved in the near
                  future she would leave him sewed up in a bolster until the minister saw fit to
                  release him, for she herself wouldn’t raise the scissors on his behalf! The threat
                  was so effective that Rebecca’s Cure became a byword among the less valiant, who
                  envied, but dared not copy, such admirable measures.</p>
               <p>The lordly male had other weaknesses, I was led to infer from
                  guarded gossip and innuendo. The fine-whiskered creatures had too keen an eye for
                  slim ankles and soft bosoms not theirs under divine contract. What was worse, the
                  rascals slipped from grace without any appreciable shame or evil consequence. They
                  carried on as shamelessly as Solomon with Sheba, secure in the knowledge that
                  wives were by law and common acceptance little better than chattel, and that, to
                  boot, the Holy Scriptures upheld the dominance of the male, in everything from
                  petticoats to predicating piety.</p>
               <p>This pleasant state of affairs was, none the less, not always
                  maintained at even keel. There were rebels even in the Victorian harems—wives, if
                  you will, who tired of the holiness of unquestioning submission and, with the
                  vindictiveness of less fortunate females, sought redress for their long-suffered
                  slights.</p>
               <p>One gentle-spoken lady, whose tragic tale I have approximated
                  elsewhere, once turned the tables on her philandering husband by installing his
                  enamorata in the guest-room of her house. To say that the master was rudely shaken
                  infers too little. The poor man exploded. Shocked to the depths of his Victorian
                  soul at the sight of his wife and the glamorous hussy chatting amicably over the
                  breakfast table, manners flew windward, and his righteous indignation boiled over.
                  What the devil did his lady mean by such scandalous behaviour? Had she lost her
                  senses? How dared she invite such a—such a—well, such a person into the same house
                  with his children? To which the maddening woman merely replied that, so far as she
                  knew, her friends had always been perfectly safe companions for
                  the children, and would so continue to be. What could you do with such a wife, I
                  wonder—what, indeed, but build a new house, and henceforth curtail, within reason,
                  those enchanting primrose pastimes.</p>
               <p>True, grown-ups were a queer lot; that I perceived, as the small
                  years lengthened and these tales were stored up in memory. At first I had expected
                  unalloyed wisdom from my elders, for were they not swift and eager to point out
                  the stupidities of a child? To confound what seemed the straightness of truth with
                  complexities of conduct beyond my understanding, and which I must of course accept
                  as right and proper? Unhappily for me, I discovered too quickly that adult
                  reasoning was a curious process, as often as not quite divorced from common sense.
                  For example, it was surely common sense not to eat what made you ill, but all the
                  same the rule did not apply to whatever article of food the doctrines of the
                  moment held to be most nutritious. So, however your stomach revolted, you
                  swallowed what mamma or papa decided was good for you, simply because mamma or
                  papa said so. The same was true of moral and religious mendacity. Every decent
                  child must learn to be truthful, modest, and obedient, and under no condition to
                  interfere with the rights and privileges of others. All of which, high sounding
                  and splendid, was tremendously appealing, until it dawned on me that almost every
                  act of my own life was interfered with by somebody, and without rhyme or reason.
                  In matters of faith I fared much better than most children, as I was to learn much
                  later. I was never forced to accept as literal the external word trappings of
                  mythology, nor was I encouraged to feed my own conceit by the happy supposition
                  that every one who adhered to another faith was at least a fool, if not actually
                  predestined to everlasting damnation. In other words, although I had to accept as
                  right and proper the superficialities of human conduct, I was not hedged about in
                  my thinking by any orthodox strictures, and, therefore, in my own childish way, I
                  began very early to form judgements and estimates of those happenings that stirred
                  my imagination.</p>
               <p>There was one tale above all others that captured my heart, and
                  which to this day seems to me more eloquent of goodness than any organized
                  charity. It had to do with a young Icelandic doctor, whose passion for the poor
                  and the outcast was only equalled by his enslavement to liquor. He was too
                  sensitive to suffering, and resented too deeply the inequalities of a social
                  system that admitted of no practical cure for the miseries of the many. Old people
                  who still remember him with affection shake their heads that such a brilliant man
                  should have ruined himself with drink. With the untroubled judgement of
                  mediocrity, which never sounds the heights or depths of profound emotion, they
                  deplore what they consider to have been the weakness in his character, never
                  suspecting that, without this vulnerability of spirit, the tenderness they admire
                  could not have existed. For it was an excess of sympathy, weariness, and tortured
                  nerves that drove him to luckless oblivion.</p>
               <p>It is said that, toward the end of his ill-starred career, his
                  colleagues would hunt for him through the taverns and saloons of the town, and
                  literally carry him back to the hospital, where some serious operation required
                  the magic they all conceded to his skilful fingers. ‘Get him sober, damn it, no
                  matter how!’</p>
               <p>Faced by an emergency, by the sight of a poor, tortured creature
                  crying for relief, the man had an almost superhuman way of snapping back to
                  instantaneous efficiency. So the legend went.</p>
               <p>He was a stormy soul, too swift in justice for the stone mouths of
                  Victorian mercy. One incident, out of a meteoric career that leaves one a little
                  stunned by its brilliant warm-heartedness, leaves all others outclassed. Or so it
                  seemed to me. It had to do with a wretchedly poor woman who, like so many others
                  of her kind, had established a home of sorts on the ‘flats’—the lowly portion of
                  the Red River banks which now have been filled in and built over with wholesale
                  houses. As so often happens with the poor, this woman had refrained from seeking
                  medical aid for her ailing child because of poverty. There was scarcely enough to
                  eat. How then should she pay a doctor?</p>
               <p>Besides, was there not God, to whom the miseries of the outcast are
                  a special charge? Surely the Divine Ear must heed and comprehend such dire
                  necessity? Surely her prayers would be answered, for had she not always been told
                  that faith, though no larger than a mustard seed, would remove mountains? Night
                  and day, her prayers went up to the Lord of Hosts in trusting supplication that
                  knew no doubt. Yet the child grew worse, and on the rounds of his duty among the
                  miserables the young doctor heard of it. But not until it was too late. The little
                  thing died, and the distracted mother found herself facing even more piteous
                  circumstances. How was the child to be buried? To whom could she turn in this
                  sorest of afflictions?</p>
               <p>Himself without funds, the doctor could offer no better solution
                  than a plea to the city. The civic authorities must, he supposed, have made some
                  provision in their laws for just such pressing emergencies. He was wrong. With
                  admirable dispatch, his appeal was heard and dismissed. Such things were not
                  within the province of the city administration, an impeccably polite individual
                  told him. It was not their business or problem to adjust domestic difficulties,
                  however tragic—they were not a charitable organization.</p>
               <p>Fury eating his heart, the doctor studied the bland face of the
                  imperturbable clerk, thinking how typical the little man was of the dead-in-life,
                  who worship the letter of the law and let the spirit go hang. How worse than
                  useless to expect intelligent, not to say sympathetic co-operation from such
                  wooden heads. Nothing would have pleased him more than to air these and other
                  similarly impolitic sentiments, but instead he replied with disarming, almost
                  humble politeness:</p>
               <p>‘You’ve set me right about my paupers. Now tell me—for a doctor
                  meets up with such unexpected problems—how would the authorities act toward a
                  suicide—say, an unclaimed corpse in the street? Would it be left to the mercy of
                  the elements?’</p>
               <p>Certainly not! The civic mouthpiece was moved to indignation.
                  Anything that endangered the public health was an immediate concern—the law
                  provided for the removal of all such nuisances. Really, the little man was wounded
                  to think that the doctor could harbour even the faintest doubts of the hygienic
                  zeal of the city fathers. To which pained accusation the offender listened with a
                  mounting gleam in his sombre grey eye, and a swiftly shaping plan forging in his
                  mind. ‘Well, that’s gratifying information,’ said he, slamming on his hat, and
                  striding from the room.</p>
               <p>An hour later he was back at the city hall with a large paper
                  carton under his arm. Dark as a thunder-cloud, he stalked into the mayor’s office.
                  His worship had left for the day, so he was told. No, there was not the slightest
                  hope of his coming back before to-morrow. ‘What a pity!’ exclaimed the visitor,
                  with malicious politeness. ‘Then I fear I must leave this bequest to his worship
                  without comment.’ With which ambiguous statement the mad young doctor deposited
                  the poor little infant corpse in its paper coffin on the mayor’s desk, and, highly
                  pleased with himself, dashed out of the building. Well, that’s once blood was
                  squeezed from a stone!</p>
               <p>The impetuous doctor has gone the way of the storm, forgotten save
                  by a few. Yet I think that the ghost of his reckless courage still walks the
                  night, jousting with fears and injustices in the old, free-handed manner; yes, and
                  that the fine passion which consumed him like a fire burns as brightly still in
                  some medium of mind, stuff for the inspiration of susceptible hearts.</p>

               <head>Vignettes of a Private World</head>
               <p>But memory is a democratic jade, and no respecter of persons. Many
                  inconsequential characters, whose distinctions were neither praiseworthy nor
                  remarkable, exercised a fascinating spell upon my imagination. There was ‘Kattar
                  Issi’ for instance, a gawky, towheaded youth, not the brightest, who derived a
                  sketchy livelihood by exterminating surplus cats. Considering my unbounded passion
                  for felines, it is not surprising that the mere mention of Issi made me sizzle
                  with plots of dire vengeance. Vindictive as any prophet of damnation, I vowed to
                  haunt him when I died, in company with all the innocent pussies he had heartlessly
                  dropped into the muddy waters of the Red River. He was, I felt convinced, the
                  worst of ogres, and ought himself to be tied in a sack and duly drowned.</p>
               <p>In reality, poor Issi was an inoffensive youth, afflicted with a
                  hare-lip, which made articulation difficult, and doubtless was largely responsible
                  for his seeming stupidity. This handicap, far from arousing pity, only
                  strengthened my displeasure and suspicion. He hissed, so what more proof was
                  needed to establish his true kinship with trolls and ogres?</p>
               <p>Issi’s last visit to our house made an indelible record upon my
                  mind. To begin with, I had not seen him for a long time—the sex of my pets having
                  liberated us from murderous proclivities—and I thought we were for ever rid of his
                  dark shadow. It was a double shock, therefore, on walking into the kitchen one
                  morning, to find him sitting at the table, grinning crookedly, and shuffling his
                  huge feet as he waited for the customary cup of coffee. Chills ran up and down my
                  spine, and a host of doubts soared up like startled birds in my protesting heart.
                  The creature wore the cheerful mask of hired villainy! I could read it in his eye
                  that pleasant business was afoot. Nor was I mistaken, for his evil genius had
                  actually been sought by my own mamma. Yes, she had sent for him, and, pert as a
                  cricket, unfolded a horrible plot.</p>
               <p>It seemed that an eminent physician—heaven forgive him!—had just
                  discovered the electric qualities of cat skins. Electro-therapy was yet undreamed,
                  it is true, yet here was a pioneer who imagined that the vibrations of such
                  supercharged skin, if applied to a weak chest, would benefit the patient. Well,
                  who was mamma to doubt the great man? Never let it be said that she refused to
                  co-operate with science—that her precious child continued croupy for lack of a cat
                  skin!</p>
               <p>Speechless, I could only stand there, a helpless accessory to the
                  plotted crime. The skin must be found at once, said mamma. And when mamma spoke in
                  that firm, clipped manner, even the angels would hesitate to tarry. The grisly
                  deed was as good as done! Yes, utterly oblivious of my sick displeasure, mamma
                  shooed me into a chair and went on with her instructions. The skin must be
                  sun-cured and properly dressed—it ought to be as soft as a chamois. And it must be
                  black!</p>
               <p>‘Well, now, ma’am,’ Issi scratched his unkempt head. ‘I can’t
                  exactly promise that for sure. Not for certain sure, anyhow. Black cats ain’t
                  being discarded just now.’ As a matter of cold fact, he hadn’t a single dusky puss
                  in prospect, and, being an honest soul, that factor presented an insurmountable
                  hurdle. Of course, he would comb the town with might and main, and fetch the
                  desired article at the first possible moment. With that, mamma had to content
                  herself—although, I’m sorry to say, I inferred from her impatience that, in a case
                  like this, she might have winked at a weaker brand of honesty. Why, for instance,
                  should not a grey mouser serve a housewife as well as a black? In the end,
                  however, it was a dark grey feline that surrendered its most precious possession
                  for my unhappy benefit. A compromise not altogether pleasing to my hopeful
                  mamma—yet I, forsooth, must wear it!</p>
               <p>For years the sin weighed upon my soul. It used to haunt me, first
                  as sheer wickedness against the dearest of pets, and later as a hateful reflection
                  upon the intelligence of my otherwise highly capable parent. It was not until
                  years later, when I met a charming French girl in Saskatchewan, and learned that
                  she too had been subjected to the cat-skin cure, that I realized how widespread
                  this ridiculous notion must have been. It had even penetrated into the
                  Territories. So far as either of us could recall, however, the only apparent
                  results were a fine frenzy of itching and an equally fine frenzy of revolt. How
                  many innocent cats were offered up on the sacrificial altar I shudder to think,
                  but, in justice to our mammas, I hasten to reaffirm that it was done at the behest
                  of a high priest of science. The nonsense cannot be laid at the door of some
                  unlettered housewife, nor to the commercialized guile of the now discredited
                  homoeopathic doctors whose pills and plasters once served us not too badly.</p>
               <p>One such genuine helpful and extremely courtly gentleman I well
                  remember. His bearded face had distinction, and his eyes twinkled with perpetual
                  good humour, as though, in the sum total of his being, he refused to accept the
                  actuality of the aches and pains he worked to alleviate. His voice was pleasantly
                  cultured, and his choice of words would have rejoiced Queen Victoria. Where his
                  medicines failed I am confident that the positive quality of his personality
                  flowed to the rescue, for he had what so many modern doctors lack—a natural
                  sympathy with human frailty and a fixed faith in the divinity of nature. The old
                  black bag he carried on every occasion, with its array of tiny bottles of every
                  hue, was a fascinating receptacle. Words cannot describe the conglomerate smells
                  that emanated from its yawning depths when the brass latch flew open: aromatic
                  Hoffman drops, volatile substances that reeked of camphor, eucalyptus, sassafras
                  and cinnamon—and, lustier than all the rest, a colourless fluid that shrieked of a
                  million murdered onions!</p>
               <p>Plasters there were, as well, black and red and white, some
                  perforated, and others cut in cunning strips for quick application to the various
                  angles of the human anatomy. Pills, like seed pearls, in small blue and green
                  bottles, sang of relief for a dozen ills, and as many pastes promised ease to
                  cramps and crimps of ageing backs and limbs. Whatever these things were, they
                  doubtless acted in proportion to the faith held in them, and very seldom I think,
                  caused any harm.</p>
               <p>The old gentleman was devoted to me, for had he not brought me into
                  the world, and he loved to tease me about my insignificant appearance. ‘Why, my
                  chick,’ he used to say, ‘you were such a scrap of a thing that your poor mamma
                  refused to believe you were born until I held you up for her to see.’ Then,
                  fearing that maidenly vanity was wounded, he would add: ‘Just the same, there was
                  nothing wrong with you. No indeed. Four pounds of fat, and—hum, I cannot say just
                  how much vociferation. That was you, my love.’</p>
               <p>This piece of news never failed to charm me when I was small, for,
                  like every other child, the mystery of my own appearance on the world scene was a
                  fascinating miracle. Papa generally helped the old gentleman by adding other, even
                  more thrilling details.</p>
               <p>‘Yes, and what is more,’ he used to say, ‘you had no will to be put
                  upon, my lamb. Although you were so small that a shoe-box could easily have been
                  your cradle, you understood perfectly how to scare the life out of papa. You see,
                  here was I, all unwarned that a daughter had come to the house, and, in my
                  surprise, sank into the old rocking-chair. Herra Gud! What a
                  squawk came from the little bundle I had nearly sat upon! That was how we met, my
                  little dear—and I don’t mind admitting I’ve had no desire to sit on you ever
                  since.’</p>
               <p>‘A child without a temper is a ship without a sail,’ the old doctor
                  supplemented, stroking my hair with a soft, white hand.</p>
               <p>‘That is so,’ papa nodded. ‘I wasn’t inferring that the little miss
                  yelled out of turn. No indeed. On the contrary, she knew from the start how to
                  conduct herself. I’ll confess I had some qualms when I took her to the baptismal
                  fount. Now, thought I, will the midget startle the angels with her howls, and
                  shame her poor father? It was an unjust suspicion. Never was there a better chick.
                  When the holy water touched the small black head—oh yes, my love, your hair was as
                  black as an Indian’s—you would have thought the child understood here was
                  something she must support with dignity. It may have been a cramp, of course, but
                  I really think she smiled!’</p>
               <p>Well, whatever it was, it seems I made a good impression in the
                  Lord’s house; that, after the ceremony, every one had to have a look at this
                  littlest of human beings, newly entered into the congregation of just men and
                  true. It was my long hair, mamma said, and no wonder, for it reached to my
                  shoulders, and made me look like a Japanese puppet, and not in the least what one
                  expected a sprig of Viking stock to be. It was this reference to my coal-black
                  hair that pleased me most. For a few days, at least, I had shared this distinction
                  with papa, whose hair had the polished sheen of a blackbird’s wing. Now mine was
                  yellow as corn tassel, and gave me no feeling of superiority, though it was so
                  long and abundant that even mamma boasted about it in her weaker moments—weakness
                  she bolstered up by explaining that, after all, it was not remarkable, since all
                  the women of her house were noted for their long hair. Yes, even that wicked
                  wretch who refused to give a lock of her tresses for the mending of Gunnar’s bow,
                  when it might have saved his life!</p>
               <p>The logical inference to be drawn from this horrid incident was
                  that handsome is as handsome does. What if I could sit on my hair? Was that
                  something of which to be puffed up about, when, at any moment, the evil blood of
                  my ancestress might lead me to undreamed mischief? Clearly, it was much more
                  profitable to remember that only the mercy of God had preserved me to be a sort of
                  witness to the power of His hand. Oh, I understood that perfectly. I had not been
                  much of a baby. I could well believe that I must have been a surprise to poor
                  mamma. Her other babies had always measured above the average in size and beauty.
                  Yet those sturdy little creatures had not survived. They came and departed. I was
                  so used to it that its sole effect was a kind of fearful distaste for all babies.
                  They were such unstable entities, predictable in nothing save the certainty of
                  their sure departure. Their cries disturbed us for a little, and then these
                  plaintive protests were stilled, leaving only my brother and myself in the
                  house.</p>
               <p>It was not until I was eight years old that a more determined being
                  made her appearance. My sister Dora was a beautiful baby of sufficient hardihood
                  to withstand the shocks of existence, and her happy advent seemed to break the
                  evil spell that heretofore had darkened the house. By this time sanitary
                  conditions had everywhere improved. Barns and livery stables were still plentiful,
                  and the disposal of middens haphazard, but, to borrow the jargon of the day, the
                  citizens were becoming fly-conscious. Lectures were given on the sins of the
                  bluebottle, and frightening pamphlets on the subject descended with increasing
                  frequency upon the heads of the people. To be discovered without screens became a
                  graver offence than to lose one’s petticoat on Main Street, and it was a common
                  sight to see whole households armed with papers and rags, wildly whisking the
                  unwelcome blue swarms from kitchen doorways. The milk supply was better handled,
                  and even the water was under such grave suspicion that no sensible mother dreamed
                  of offering an unboiled drop to her baby. All this was something gained, and
                  doubtless accounted in no small measure for the drop in infant mortality.</p>
               <p>Many unrelated incidents crowd into the memory of those years:
                  individual pictures that, for some obscure reason, remain clear-cut and defined,
                  even though I have no way of fixing the actual time or place. Oddly enough, it was
                  not the concrete and more spectacular of these events that most impressed me. For
                  example, it must have been rather jolly when the band came to practise at our
                  house, especially when the ‘boys’ were rehearsing for Victoria Day. They made a
                  tremendous noise, I know, and mamma beamed upon them impartially, and fed them
                  with pancakes and coffee. I thought them remarkable creatures, and was filled with
                  elation if my brother let me hold his horn for a moment. Yet I was much more
                  affected when, one evening, papa led me into the front room to inspect a new
                  picture of Laurier and the Cabinet. Quite as though I were his equal, and not a
                  fat little girl in pigtails, father named the various gentlemen, defining their
                  importance, and in conclusion pointing out the handsome figure of the great
                  Frenchman, saying: ‘There stands an earnest man. Remember that, little Lalla—for
                  it is only through the earnest heart that God works justice on the earth.’</p>
               <p>The words meant nothing, but the serious inflection of papa’s
                  voice, which was always gentle and warmly human, sent a thrill through my whole
                  being. Although I could not understand my own swift reaction, I had the lovely
                  feeling of being caught up into something vital and important; as though papa and
                  I shared a beautiful secret which made us heirs of untold riches beyond the
                  stars.</p>
               <p>A darker thrill concerns another picture, and is associated with
                  mamma and my visit to the Borgfords, where sister Anna lived. I remember very
                  little of the house, which was bleak and scrupulously clean, and where the
                  goodness of its gentle mistress fought bravely against the stern overtones of a
                  harsh house-father. Mr. Borgford, it was said, prided himself on being a good
                  provider, but one instinctively felt that this generosity did not extend to any
                  marked degree to the innermost needs of his wife. Small though I was, I sensed
                  something tragic in Mrs. Borgford’s eager defence of her domineering husband, for
                  it was so obvious that her affectionate nature, though starved and denied a
                  natural outlet, shrank with almost physical pain before the least suggestion of
                  blame. Somehow, I never could form any definite image of Aunt Malfridur, possibly
                  because of her great contrast with my firm little mother, whose characteristics
                  were so knowable and fixed. There was nothing vague about mamma, nothing
                  apologetic or uncertain. She knew her own mind and its limitations, and let it be
                  clearly understood that in this and any other life, she would sail under her own
                  colours upon her own charted highway, with utmost efficiency, and with that the
                  world and her God would have to be content.</p>
               <p>With equal honesty and without blame, she recognized the
                  limitations of others, and neither defended nor condemned them—with this
                  exception: stupidity and hypocrisy tried her patience. What was the good of fools,
                  she wondered, and how could any human being embrace the cult of Judas without
                  shame? Mamma was, I sometimes used to think, very like her old ancestors, who put
                  to sea in their little ships, nothing daunted by the pounding waves, for their
                  attitude to life was wisely impersonal; their indifference to danger the result of
                  an inner feeling of kinship with the stress and storm of nature.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Borgford, on the other hand, gave one the impression of
                  perpetual uncertainty, as though she lived in secret conflict under the shadow of
                  fears that drove her this way and that, irrespective of her ardent desire to
                  placate and please. Children form queer ideas that on the surface seem to have
                  small relation to the truth, but, when I grew older, I learned from my father that
                  this aunt of his, whom he deeply respected, was not so far removed from my
                  childish impression. It was his opinion that ironic destiny had chained a dove to
                  a hawk in that household, to the complete subjection of the one without marked
                  benefit to the other.</p>
               <p>At the time of our visit, however, I was only conscious of Aunt
                  Borgford’s fluttering kindness. I have not the least idea what the coffee
                  conversation was about that day, nor what I did to amuse myself. I knew that mamma
                  was waiting to see my sister when she came home from school, and I remember that,
                  when she finally arrived, bright-eyed and merry, the bleak old house seemed to
                  relax its austerity, stretch and yawn, and settle down with a sigh. Anna was then
                  a young girl in her ’teens, too tall and thin for beauty, but with the lively
                  charm and handsome eyes that characterized father’s people.</p>
               <p>To my thinking, Big Sister was a marvellous being whom I secretly
                  envied, for it was a source of grievance to me that no one ever said I resembled
                  papa. Nor could I really blame them when I looked in the glass. My familiar face
                  was round as an apple, ridiculously grave, and not even my best friend, Nonni,
                  would have perjured his soul by claiming I had ‘Irish-grey eyes’ like my father.
                  No, the oftener I gazed at myself, the more surely I knew how unkind the fairies
                  had been at my birth. There was no good fooling myself. I was just the sort of fat
                  little girl an ogre might like for his pot, and whom no king’s son on shining
                  steed would ever break his neck to rescue.</p>
               <p>So here was my lively sister, with her dancing grey eyes,
                  chattering to mamma with an ease she must certainly have inherited from our
                  father. I could only hang over mamma’s chair and hope that no one noticed how
                  stupid I was. And when I heard Aunt Malfridur telling sister she ought to do
                  something to amuse the dear child. That was I, of course, worse luck! Now I should
                  have to bore Big Sister, for what could I answer such a paragon?</p>
               <p>‘Why don’t you show your little sister your collection of
                  handkerchiefs?’ my aunt went on. ‘That would be nice, don’t you think? And better,
                  if you gave her one. You have so many, my love.’</p>
               <p>Here was another manifestation of adult ignorance! Why, for
                  goodness’ sake, should my sister show me her handkerchiefs? Why should I see them?
                  Had I not seen a thousand in Yes-mam’s bundle—handkerchiefs with roses like
                  cabbages and birds with stiff wings and stomachs rounder than my own? More
                  reasonless still, why should sister give me something against her will?</p>
               <p>Well, there was no help for it. When big folk made up their minds
                  to be kind, it was as hard to dodge the assault as to slip through a snowball
                  fight. As bored as myself, sister told me to come along, and out came the
                  handkerchief box—and there were the scraps of silk, exactly as I knew they would
                  be. Like a little owl, I stared at the fine pile, marvelling at the fleetness of
                  sister’s fingers as she leafed through it.</p>
               <p>‘Here is one you can have,’ said she, kindly enough, glad to be
                  done with the job. No doubt it was a pretty handkerchief, but I really never saw
                  it—as I never saw anything I did not want to see in those wiser infant days. I’m
                  sure that I received it with a shameless lack of enthusiasm, and, quite possibly,
                  might have further disgraced myself if I had not, so to say, in the nick of time,
                  discovered the awe-inspiring picture which instantly changed the face of the
                  world.</p>
               <p>It was a common print of Joan of Arc at the stake—a grim
                  representation of the Immortal Maid in her final agony, the black smoke writhing
                  upward from the faggots at her feet, the makeshift cross of twigs uplifted in her
                  tortured, supplicating hands. A common enough picture in those days, when popular
                  taste was not yet freed from Calvinistic sadism. To me, however, it was not a
                  framed print upon a cottage wall in a mundane prairie town. It was a living
                  experience so profound that everything else faded out of mind. What happened after
                  my senses were caught up and swallowed in that awful scene I cannot say. I cannot
                  even remember going home. It was just as though the centuries had fallen away, and
                  that every act of that piteous drama were being enacted anew, with only my eyes
                  the unwilling witness and my heart the centre of deathless pain. I was no longer
                  my comfortable familiar self, the fat little girl with an apple face and yellow
                  pigtails. I was a point in consciousness, where the repercussions of that
                  long-stilled torment registered with incredible intensity.</p>
               <p>Horror clamped down on me with an iron hand, and I could not even
                  scream, for my lungs were filling with smoke, and my limbs held fast in burning
                  bands of steel. I stood there like a stupid sheep, hearing nothing that was said
                  to me, lost in an eternity of suffering I could not even understand, and would
                  never in the world have dared to mention. Even papa would have been displeased
                  with such exaggerated emotion, and mamma, I knew, would have doubted my
                  sanity.</p>
               <p>Of course, I had often suspected that I was queer, for my moods
                  tended, at times, to objectify in pictures, with which I liked to amuse myself.
                  But here was something that leaped at me unawares, unprovoked by imagination, and
                  therefore terrifying. And that abominable experience pursued me. In the dead of
                  night the picture came rushing out of a thick grey cloud, and no sooner recognized
                  than, bang! went frame and glass, and there were the billows of fire and smoke
                  which hideously enveloped, but never obscured, the tortured martyr.</p>
               <p>I hated these intense reactions to painted atmosphere. I hated
                  them, as every child hates anything that marks him as different from his sensible
                  little companions. No one could have dragged the confession from me. If I read all
                  sorts of absurd nonsense into the most ordinary pictures, and in my dreams saw the
                  most amazing people engaged in utterly unfamiliar pursuits, I decided that, for
                  decency’s sake, I could at least keep the weakness to myself. One had to have his
                  senses about him in this world, for the Lord had no patience with people who could
                  not tell substance from shadow—so mamma said on many occasions, when the porridge
                  was thin, and papa’s gaze too ardently fixed on some invisible paradise.</p>
               <p>Still, there were exceptions, she admitted, with her usual,
                  unswerving honesty. Poets were bound by no common rule, yet even they, poor dears,
                  more often than not, found it hard to buy a shoe-string with a dream, to say
                  nothing of the shoe itself. I could not doubt the wisdom of these observations,
                  and therefore piously vowed on all ten fingers that, by the help of the holy
                  saints, I would for ever forsake the vainglory of dreams. No, there was no
                  question of doubt, for even I could see the difference between papa’s old Prince
                  Albert and the glossy black coat worn by a brisk gentleman who sometimes whisked
                  past the house behind a pair of high-stepping bays, on his round of inspecting the
                  ugly row of cottages his foresight had built for trusting foreigners. Certainly,
                  no concrete good came of dilly-dallying with dreams. And yet, I have come to
                  wonder if my queer obsession with that harrowing picture was not largely
                  responsible for the curious, fraternal feeling I have for the past. A feeling
                  deeper than interest, swifter than insight, and not at all dependent upon written
                  history—a feeling inseparable from the conviction that human experience,
                  translated into mind-stuff, is timeless with eternity; that, in the eternal, the
                  past is co-existent with the present, and the future; that everything that ever
                  was, or ever will be, lived out under the chiming clock of the years, is nothing
                  but the slow unfolding, incarnation by incarnation, of the Divine principle
                  seeking expression in matter. Whatever this living, all-sustaining, and
                  all-inclusive medium of being really is matters nothing, it seems to me. But to
                  perceive that all creatures, now and for ever, are extensions of it rounds the sum
                  of existence into a crystal sphere, wherein whosoever has eyes to see can read a
                  fascinating epic.</p>
               <p>Even without much vision, it must be clear to most that the past
                  lives in us—that we are not products of one generation, and limited to the
                  peculiar attributes of a sole set of parents. We were forsworn in the loins of the
                  remotest ancestor, and shall continue until the last living form is extinct. Is it
                  so strange, then, to imagine that man’s emotional nature, which is just another
                  expression of universal activity, may, in moments of great stress, somehow
                  register its patterned feeling upon the living ether—if one may use such a term—in
                  which we have our being? Is it beyond the bounds of reason that a sensitive mind
                  may upon occasion react to such heightened vibrations and be moved by them at
                  least to similar feelings, resentments, glooms, or exaltations, even though the
                  experience go no further? If not, what are inspirations, and what better
                  explanation has been offered for the strange visions of many honest men and women?
                  Were they all epileptics and fools? Were all the mighty prophets, whose
                  impassioned words still ring down the dark arches of the years, and all the
                  star-enamoured visionaries, whose dreams, once despised, are now realities, were
                  they all ignorant victims of egomania and hallucinations? How pitiful then is the
                  lot of the blessedly sane! How little reason for envying the proudly practical,
                  who live and breed and perish like mice in cheese, without so much as a single
                  enraptured glimpse of the golden moon!</p>
               <p>Alas, none of these pleasant conceits comforted me at the time of
                  which I write. Joan continued to haunt me with her smoke and fire, and other
                  ghostly personages joined in the tireless sport. Seemingly, I was just a round
                  little human sponge that eagerly sucked up every drop of emotion that splashed
                  from the crock of life. It was a queer sort of ingrown existence for a child—the
                  sort, in fact, that would make a modern psychologist swoon with horror—and yet I
                  survived those unhealthy fevers, just as doggedly as I survived the onslaughts of
                  measles, scarlatina, and the cat skin. And, somehow, by scarcely perceptible
                  degrees, the narrow limits of my confining horizon spread and widened.</p>
               <p>One beautiful, warm evening, as in a trice, the boundaries of the
                  world, which had been so comfortably snug and small, sprang apart, and there I
                  was, suddenly face to face with undreamed vistas of incredible space. Mother and I
                  were sitting in the back-yard, when papa came out, full of excitement, a newly
                  opened letter in his hands. It was from his sister, who lived in some mysterious
                  place called the United States.</p>
               <p>‘Can you believe it!’ papa began, visibly stirred to deepest
                  excitement. ‘Little Finny has joined the army. He is going to war!’</p>
               <p>Clearly this referred to my cousin, whom I remembered as a leggy
                  youth full of fun and mischief. By some miracle, he had become a different
                  creature—the sort that pranced through the pages of history books with sabres and
                  swords and such commotion that one felt the yellow leaves of the books groan and
                  shiver.</p>
               <p>‘Heaven help us!’ exclaimed mamma, frowning, and not at all
                  thrilled. ‘Why must people kill each other to settle arguments? At least we have
                  learned better than that in Iceland, thanks be to God!’</p>
               <p>Papa brushed this aside. ‘He will make a good soldier, never doubt
                  it,’ he said, staring off into the sunset, quite as though the yellow streamers of
                  the sun were the proud banners of a conquering host of heroes. So, naturally, I
                  too must plant myself at papa’s side, and strain my weak eyes in the hope of
                  catching a glimpse of the gallant company. They were marching into a land called
                  Cuba, where the Spaniards were misbehaving.</p>
               <p>This was certainly a shock, for heretofore I had only thought of
                  Spain in terms of señoritas with rings in their ears, and twinkling castanets in
                  their supple fingers. Then, too, what were they doing in Cuba? A horrible place,
                  full of swamps, papa said, where something infinitely more dangerous than bullets
                  awaited the American soldiers. Swamps were the breeding-place of fevers, which I
                  could easily enough visualize as a burning sort of sickness that shrank the skin
                  off your bones, and left you a yellow skeleton, only fit to scare bad, bad
                  children. According to papa, a good clean war was not so intolerable, for its
                  dangers were predictable, and a quick death was nothing to fear, but who could
                  strive against pestilence in a barbarous country? No, he had no doubts whatever
                  but that little Finny would acquit himself with valour, if only fate kept him out
                  of the swamps.</p>
               <p>‘Well, then, why doesn’t he stay home?’ demanded mamma. ‘That’s
                  what’s wrong with you men—you talk sense for amusement, and when it comes to
                  action, you behave as though the good God had forgotten to put an ounce of brains
                  into your heads. I’ll thank you not to be talking war in this house. I was reared
                  a Christian, please remember.’</p>
               <p>‘Tut! Tut! A lot that means, my love,’ papa grinned, his grey eyes
                  lighted for combat. ‘Who were the bloodiest fighters, if not the Christians, I ask
                  you? Yes, my love, I seem to have read somewhere that even to our small country
                  protestantism came at the point of the sword.’</p>
               <p>‘Poof!’ Mamma rose with a swirl of cotton skirts. ‘What does that
                  signify, Lars Gudmundson? What else could you expect of the Danes, no matter what
                  they called themselves. What I’m very sure of is that nowhere is it written that
                  the Icelanders rushed up and down any country shaming their Blessed Saviour. I’m
                  going in to put on the coffee-pot. If little Finny comes home again, it’s more
                  than your sister deserves—God forgive her!—if she writes as foolishly as you are
                  talking.’</p>
               <p>Of course, papa said no more that night, which was rather a pity,
                  since my skull was aching with all sorts of questions I should liked to have
                  asked. The following weeks brought more letters, fortunately, and though mamma
                  refrained from voicing any sinful curiosity, she never objected when papa read
                  these communications at the supper-table. The same was true of the weekly papers,
                  which more and more featured the fortunes of war, and, very soon, it appeared that
                  papa had been right about the swamps. The soldiers died like flies of yellow
                  fever, many of them without the glory of firing a single shot for the grand myth
                  of liberty. Still, the conflict went gallantly on, piling up profits for the
                  meat-packers, who were selling rotten supplies to the army. When papa expressed
                  this opinion I was rudely shaken, whereas mamma seemed to soften, and listened
                  more patiently to the scandalous articles. It was just as though her silence were
                  shouting: What can you expect? Is it surprising that people who countenance murder
                  should be thieves and liars as well? Is it harder to cheat your neighbour than to
                  take his son to be the target of hate in which he had no part? Come, come, Lars,
                  use a little sense!</p>
               <p>So here was I, all of a muddle. The gallant company whose banners I
                  had seen in the sun were somewhere wallowing about in a dirty swamp, eating rotten
                  meat. Was that the fate of heroes? Was it, then, the patriotic duty of little
                  Finny to stuff himself on musty beef, so that the meat-packers, whom I imagined as
                  whiskered monsters stirring a huge cauldron full of carcasses, should get rich as
                  the terrible giants in folk-lore? Moreover, there were other surprising angles to
                  the war business. Every American child was made to purchase a shining button for
                  its righteous breast. The button had on it the picture of a furious-looking
                  battleship, with, over it, the provocative caption, ‘Remember the Maine!’</p>
               <p>What a lucrative idea that was! How stimulating to the hearts of
                  innocent children. My good aunt sent me one of these precious emblems, which,
                  alas! mamma promptly threw away, almost as fiercely as she had flung out the wild
                  rabbit papa once brought home. ‘So!’ she had ejaculated that time. ‘It is not
                  enough to bring us to a savage country, but you must introduce heathen food? Well,
                  my man, you won’t get me cooking cats, let me tell you!’ And out went the rabbit,
                  flying through the door like a startled shadow—nor have I ever had the courage to
                  sample that particular food.</p>
               <p>The climax of thrills came when Lieutenant Hobson sank the Merrimac under the very noses of the Spanish command. Dear me,
                  he, at least, must have eaten better fare than the poor lads in the swamps,
                  thought I, swelling with vicarious courage.</p>
               <p>‘Humph!’ sniffed mamma. ‘Let’s hope he lives to use his wits more
                  profitably.’</p>
               <p>Poor lieutenant! How little he suspected at the time that the
                  barrage of Spanish gunfire he so cheerfully braved was only a bagatelle in
                  comparison with the deadly battery that awaited his homecoming. In short, the
                  enraptured ladies of the victorious republic fell upon him with such violent
                  manifestations of affection that the undignified spectacle led to his being
                  demoted in rank. ‘Well, of course!’ sighed papa, ‘only kings and cardinals, and
                  bespangled admirals, can make fools of themselves to good effect.’ Which is
                  doubtless very true, and therefore makes it something of a miracle that the dear,
                  discredited hero was eventually recompensed for the furious kisses of the ladies
                  when his constituency elected him to congress.</p>
               <p>For me, be it confessed, the glory of the Spanish-American War was
                  not epitomized in Hobson and Dewey, but in the amazing fact that cousin Finny,
                  marching home under flying colours, showed himself a ‘true and gentle knight’. He
                  had saved his wages, and bought his mother a fur coat! There were tears in mamma’s
                  eyes when she heard that. The darling boy! She had always known he had a heart of
                  gold. Didn’t we remember how kind he was to dumb animals? God love him. Think of
                  it! Now my aunt could make her rounds among the sick, even in the coldest weather,
                  as proudly warm as the fine ladies on Broadway for whom she once scoured and
                  scrubbed. Sometimes one got a whiff of justice here below! Nor was this all. My
                  generous aunt must share her good fortune, so what does she do but send me five
                  dollars! Gracious goodness, what a shock we had when the bill fluttered out of the
                  envelope like some strange, heavenly bird. How my eyes popped. How utterly beyond
                  my wildest imaginings was the conception of such an enormous sum! When the
                  pinpricks and heart-thumping eased a bit, I began to wonder if I couldn’t buy a
                  horse and carriage—or, at least, a house. But no. Mamma had instantly recovered
                  her composure and all her good sense. The money must go for a winter coat.
                  Obviously that was the inference to be drawn from the letter. Dear Aunt Haldora
                  wanted me to be as comfortable as herself.</p>
               <p>If such had only been the case! Instead, the bitter truth must out.
                  Never in the world was there a little red coat more hated than that which mamma
                  made for me—never a little creature more miserable so attired. Oh, it was warm
                  enough—warm as a fiery furnace, and red as blood. A perfect Santa Claus coat! A
                  little red horror trimmed in white fur and with a silver buckle. On a small,
                  rotund miss, it shrieked for attention—bellowed to high heaven for all and sundry
                  to behold this roly-poly, female miniature of Father Christmas. To say that I
                  loathed this beauteous garment, which my mother prized so highly because it was of
                  pure wool, and trimmed with real fur, is a gross understatement. Why, even now,
                  when I think of that woollen nightmare, I find myself wishing that the hero of the
                     Merrimac had never been born—that Randolph Hearst had died
                  of newsprint in the cradle, and that Cuba had never sprouted sugarcane—which is
                  wickedly to wish that the glorious Spanish-American War had never come to pass,
                  with its sweet bonus of five dollars to me!</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XV</head>
            <div>
               <head>Selkirk Interlude</head>
               <p>It must have been about the time that our new baby was six or eight
                  months old that papa experienced one of his many lapses from common sense. He was
                  fed up with ‘The Saddlery’! He was so utterly sick of the soulless grind that he
                  warned us in a loud voice he was done with such drudgery for ever. He had made up
                  his mind we should all be better off on a patch of land near Selkirk. It was
                  ridiculous to go on shivering and sneezing, never warm enough, and half-fed, in a
                  dirty prairie town, when we might be basking in sunshine and fresh air, and eating
                  the produce of our own fields. He was done with such foolishness, and let no one
                  imagine his mind could be altered.</p>
               <p>Mamma said nothing. She seemed always to understand when opposition
                  to papa’s dreams was futile, and, to reconcile herself to the scheme in hand with
                  exactly the same inescapable forbearance one has for an act of God. Papa was like
                  that, so what could you do about it? This admirable acceptance did not, however,
                  extend to whole-hearted co-operation, for mamma had not a flexible mind in matters
                  concerning the practical issues of life. She was, despite her romantic marriage,
                  too much the daughter of a family whose habits and behaviour were fixed as the
                  bounds of the sea, and which bounds of sensible behaviour nothing less than a
                  major catastrophe could induce them to disregard. It was part of their tradition
                  of loyalty that mamma should, as a matter of course, bow to the periodic folly of
                  her husband, without in the least lending moral support to such silly
                  aberrations.</p>
               <p>When I was a baby she had followed papa to Minnesota, where they
                  were no sooner settled and the owners of a neat little house, than the wanderlust
                  struck again. This time it was the sheep ranch in Dakota that lured my poor father
                  from the path of virtue. Once again she had followed without complaint, and now
                  that I realize how incomprehensible these vagrant ways must have been to my dear
                  mother I marvel at her generosity in so seldom referring, in other than a
                  half-humorous vein, to these wretched experiments. Yet I sometimes suspect that
                  papa’s failure in these ventures was foredoomed by the powerful undercurrent of
                  her unexpressed displeasure. There was always an unconscious contest of wills
                  between them. If mamma appeared to bend and obey in any given circumstance, I
                  quickly came to realize that the ultimate humiliation would be father’s.</p>
               <p>Now it was tacitly agreed upon that a piece of land on the
                  outskirts of Selkirk was to be the pleasant solution of our tiresome penury.
                  Almost at once the exodus began. First of all brother Minty was sent ahead with
                  the cow—for believe it or not we now had such an animal. This seemingly simple
                  chore proved an onerous business. The cow, true to her sex, quickly revealed an
                  amazingly recalcitrant and mischievous nature.</p>
               <p>On the face of it, naturally, that twenty-five mile pilgrimage
                  through a primitive country struck my light-hearted brother as a most thrilling
                  possibility. There was no telling what dark dangers lurked in the leafy bend of
                  the old Red River road! So many ragged half-breeds wandering the countryside lent
                  themselves so handily to the tricks of imagination. . . . For of course every one
                  knew that the devil himself could not predict what a red man full of whisky might
                  do! Fortunately considering the brave hazards, brother had an equally high-hearted
                  friend who readily agreed to lay down his life if need be for our darling
                  Bossy.</p>
               <p>With ample lunches of rolled pancakes and brown bread done up in
                  bundles attached to stout sticks, the barefoot heroes started off at dawn with the
                  fat red cow bawling behind them. All went merrily for the first five or six miles.
                  Then Bossy developed temperament. Her real nature came to the fore. With
                  astonishing caprice she rebelled against the promised land, resisting all
                  endearments, urgencies, and arguments. Switches and prods and high-handed tyranny
                  had some effect, it is true, but the upshot was that Dame Bossy lay down, militant
                  resolution in every fold of her thick red hide. Hot and disgruntled, her
                  frustrated champions made camp.</p>
               <p>Well, that was fun after a fashion. Until the night came down in a
                  rush of mantling sable. Then how quickly were the youngsters disillusioned! The
                  ‘stilly night’ tenderly depicted in rustic verse was, it seemed, nothing of the
                  sort. Sheer deception, that’s what it was! No sooner was the dusk settled about
                  them than a million mysterious noises leaped up from every crook and hollow. Worse
                  still, something at first only felt in the bones, which may well have been the
                  rhythmic snoring of overburdened Mamma-nature, assumed distressing audibility.
                  Louder than Gabriel’s Trump, it sounded sharp warning: Look here, my lads, this is
                  no time for napping; the hounds of mischief must have their run now and then. Oh
                  very plainly it was a time for extreme discretion, to say the least. Even the
                  frivolous wind had folded its wings and, done with capers, crept through the land
                  on cautious feet. The river sobbed in its long brown beard as it slipped past the
                  shuddering red willows. . . .</p>
               <p>Quickly the boys built a shelter of green boughs which, alas! was
                  no meet cover in such dire stress. Nodding in the midst of a gory yarn, down came
                  a knotted branch with the explosive crack of a pistol shot! Oh, say what you will,
                  grey ghosts were abroad that night. Nor they alone. Things that sniffed and
                  snuffled scurried by. Rabbits, said Reason. . . . But then in such a wild place
                  might it not have been bears? Indeed there were awful moments when the boys
                  wondered if a werewolf wasn’t hanging about waiting for the first sound of their
                  helpless slumber. However, even the most ghost-ridden night comes to an end and
                  all her dark hounds are chained to the farthest star. The gayest sun came bounding
                  up over the tree-tops; birds sailed into the yellow air, singing at the tops of
                  their voices; the wind, freshened with dew, went scampering among the leaves,
                  pinching their small green faces and babbling nonsense in their little ears.
                  Everything was drenched in goodwill. Even Dame Bossy showed a change of heart and
                  jogged along, patient as a lamb, and only now and again breaking out into hoarse
                  and melancholy mooing.</p>
               <p>That same morning mamma, baby, and I set off by train. Father for
                  whom this rendezvous with nature was to have been a source of healing inspiration,
                  remained in Winnipeg. Oh, it wouldn’t be for long, said he, gaily kissing us
                  good-bye, and feeling really thrilled to be bundling us off on a real journey.
                  Just a few more months of the old grind and with careful saving he’d be able to
                  add to our dozen chickens, lay in groceries for the house and feed for the cow.
                  That done he would stamp the Winnipeg gumbo off his feet for ever, and happy as a
                  harper come and join us in good time to cut the winter’s wood and bring in a nice
                  fat Christmas tree. Poor papa! His face beamed with joy as these jolly plans came
                  tumbling from his lips. In his grey eyes there shone a happy light that oddly
                  enough made me want to cry. But of course one did not cry on a fine train full of
                  strangers with bundles and babies and bags of food. So we all kissed papa the
                  second time and I at least hoped his dream would come true. . . . Oh well, he did
                  join us for the occasional week-end—which is perhaps all that dreamers deserve in
                  a world such as this.</p>
               <p>By nightfall we had reached our patch of land and were scarcely
                  through inspecting the house when the bellowing of the cow announced the safe
                  arrival of the weary pilgrims. It was a pleasant spot papa had chosen. The house,
                  though bleak and grey and forlorn as a spinster in its patch of prairie, was far
                  better than mamma had expected. Soap and water and our united energy would soon
                  put it into fine shape. The first thing to do was to get the stove up and the
                  kettle on for coffee. . . .</p>
               <p>Except for mamma’s incurable aversion for the country, I think we
                  might have been truly happy there—fared more decently than was possible in the
                  city. To me it was a delicious interlude. Here at last was a green field I might
                  have for my own—wide and free and unsaddened by cavalcades of crosses as was that
                  other in which I once had longed to try my feet. Here I might wander at will,
                  wheeling the big yellow baby carriage, with my old grey tomcat for company. Gráni
                  was a haughty creature who sometimes paced along with the dignified mien of a
                  stout grey friar absorbed in metaphysical abstractions. At other times he stalked
                  the tall grass low-bellied as a hungry tiger, and fierce as the jungle killer
                  leaped side-wise, hissing furiously, as with unsheathed claws he pounced upon some
                  unsuspecting prairie flower. Bless his bold heart! It was a rare game for the
                  mighty hunter, and not infrequently I sat down by the mangled corpse with kitty on
                  my lap while each of us in his own way sang a proper dirge. With so much that was
                  new and delightful all about me I had no difficulty finding amusement. Neither
                  then, nor ever, have I been lonely, except in crowds, where the tangled moods of
                  humanity press in like jungle creepers. I can still recapture with a pleasant glow
                  the effects of those long-gone Selkirk sunsets; how they transformed the low
                  marshes in the foreground, turning every rusty blade of coarse grass to spears of
                  gold; the little pools of bog-water to shields of polished bronze. Best of all
                  were the bullfrogs. How I loved them! How eagerly I waited for the sound of the
                  first hoarse voices that heralded the tireless chorus of unbroken passion to
                  follow.</p>
               <p>If I could only sing like that! I used to sigh enviously; sing and
                  sing and sing, with never a pause for breath—nor need to wheeze and cough! It was
                  simply impossible to think of sleeping without a stolen rendezvous at the window.
                  Cautious as pussy when he crept upon mamma’s bed, I used to steal across the
                  floor, and safely perched in the window-sill I’d sniff the delicious fragrance of
                  the night and feel my heart contracting with the same joy that rumbled up from the
                  tiny breasts of my little marsh choristers. There were so many of them that not
                  for an instant was there a break in their fervent vocalizing. From breast to
                  breast the rusty music beat, calling, calling, calling—until at last even the
                  brooding Night unfurled her smoky pinions, to weave a stately minuet beneath the
                  smiling stars.</p>
               <p>If I tired of the marshes I had only to shift my gaze to the dark
                  bluffs north of the house, where, through the thinning ranks, low stars twinkled
                  like knowing eyes and a baby moon sometimes climbed the sky, branch by branch, the
                  little sweet! and then with a wink at the helpful trees, sprang clear into the
                  blue. As a matter of fact, however, I kept the woods for daytime speculation—their
                  shadows were too long at night. Besides, mamma had given them a dual character.
                  That they were beautiful she did not deny, but in a land like this who could tell
                  what dreadful deeds they harboured?</p>
               <p>I should have liked nothing better than to romp through those leafy
                  stretches all day long, for, dreadful deeds or no, I felt at ease with the lovely
                  slender birches, the black poplars, and the friendly maples. Mamma shook her head.
                  I must confine my play to the open fields, where she could keep an eye on me—and
                  where I could wheel the baby.</p>
               <p>There was some justification for my mother’s caution. The country
                  was full of restless half-breeds—homeless malcontents who had been overtaken by
                  the evil fate that good Father Lacombe had laboured so long to avert. A new way of
                  life had robbed them of the only livelihood for which their restless souls were
                  fitted. The day of the buffalo hunt and the river brigade was done; Father
                  Lacombe’s attempt to settle ‘his children’ on the land had failed. Now they were
                  derelicts, debauched by the white man’s whisky, enfeebled by the white man’s
                  disease, drifting aimlessly before the deepening storm. These unhappy vagrants
                  were not by nature vicious, but continued drunkenness made them quarrelsome, and
                  their pastimes, more often than not, were wildly orgiastic. I have a vivid
                  recollection of more than one such revelry, for, as we were shortly to discover,
                  the marshes round our house had long been a favourite bivouac of the Metis. There
                  was something uncanny and a little frightening in the way they would suddenly
                  materialize out of the night. One moment the plain was silent and dark and the
                  next filled with noise and confusion and the red glare of leaping fires.</p>
               <p>From my bedroom window I had now a very different chorus to follow,
                  with my heart in my ears; a very different scene on which to feed my eyes. Instead
                  of the Night, dancing to the stars, dervish figures swooped and circled round the
                  fires; tossing their arms and writhing like creatures in torment. Their songs, gay
                  at the start, quickly gave place to shouts and shrieks and blasphemies—as their
                  tortured dancing was followed by indescribable obscenities. How glad I was to know
                  that mother always pulled the blinds the moment the noise began and, determined to
                  lend no single thread of consciousness to such ribaldry, retreated to her
                  rocking-chair, book in hand. I know that she always hoped that I had fallen
                  asleep, and she would have been thoroughly ashamed of me had she known that I was
                  happily ensconced on the window-sill. ‘Did you sleep well, my child?’ she often
                  asked over the morning coffee, her own eyes strained from lack of rest. ‘Yes,’ I
                  hastily replied—which was true according to the letter, even though the spirit of
                  honesty was somehow betrayed. I really had slept—but I knew quite well that that
                  was not the root of mamma’s anxiety. She was afraid that such sounds and sights
                  would corrupt me, coarsen the fibres of my mind, and cause me to disgrace the
                  august ancestors.</p>
               <p>She need not have been troubled. I was totally unaware of any
                  sinister or sinful significance in those savage antics. To me they were simply
                  part of the deep mysterious night. I accepted the noisy clamour as simply as I
                  accepted the rolling thunder, and the white lightning stroke which splits the
                  heavens apart. Yet I think there was a sense in which these midnight revellers
                  deeply affected my growing perception of life. Their strange behaviour made me see
                  normal folk in clearer light by reason of the sharp contrast. It made me prick up
                  my ears more avidly than before when some gossip dropped in for a cheering cup.
                  Which was natural enough when you stop to think of it. For, I said to myself, if
                  the drab, lifeless half-breeds who squatted for hours in the village street were
                  suddenly transformed into howling dervishes defying God and man, why, who could
                  tell what sort of demon might not lie curled in the breast of even the mildest
                  mortal? At any rate it was a charming speculation to which I owe many an amusing
                  vignette that leaps to mind at the slightest provocation. For instance, whenever
                  any one uses the silly phrase, ‘a fallen woman’, I am instantly reminded of a
                  dark-browed young woman, furiously sweeping a cottage floor with a bright new
                  broom. Another paradox, you see. Whatever I had expected as the true and proper
                  occupation of such a sinner it was certainly not wielding a broom. But that’s what
                  my Magdalene was doing, and not in the best of tempers, either, the day that mamma
                  and I came to visit the old people. ‘God pity their wretchedness!’ our only
                  neighbour groaned, in telling the story. Ella was not the first daughter to fall
                  by the wayside; there was another who had scarcely doffed her confirmation veil
                  and laid aside the catechism than she forgot that man is a miserable worm not to
                  be trusted by a Christian female. ‘Well, picture to yourself what it means to be
                  the parents of two fallen women!’ our neighbour exclaimed in such a tearful chesty
                  tone that I was not at all surprised when mamma, who rarely visited any one, said
                  with a sigh that she guessed it was her duty to visit the poor old souls.</p>
               <p>As we trudged along the rutted lane, pushing the baby buggy by
                  turns, I kept wondering what kind of disease made one a fallen woman. Was it a
                  blight, like Issi’s hare-lip, that gave his honest face a dishonest leer? Or was
                  it a misery in the bones, such as old Yes-mam complained of, and which bent you
                  double as a bowstring in a robber’s ready fist? Reasonable assumptions, yet I
                  somehow felt that neither one fitted the case. Our eagle-eyed neighbour would not
                  have given a second glance to Issi. Plainly here was something too deep for
                  superficial discernment and the simple mind of a child.</p>
               <p>‘Mamma, what’s a fallen woman?’ I finally demanded breathlessly,
                  and, knowing my parent, resolutely added while yet there was time: ‘Is that what
                  made Ella a ruined character?’</p>
               <p>Mother was always a bluntly truthful woman, averse from all
                  hypocrisy and dilly-dallying. Nevertheless, for a wavering moment, she was
                  obviously tempted to forswear her good angel. Then she said:</p>
               <p>‘That’s a hard thing to say of any one, dear child. Remember that.
                  And remember this, as well: if Ella is ruined, she has herself to thank for it.
                  She ought to have known better than to trust a man. Now the poor creature will
                  have a baby on her hands, and not a penny to her name!’</p>
               <p>Here was a pretty puzzle, forsooth! So there were babies and
                  babies! The harmless sort, referred to in whispers as just another mouth to feed,
                  and this other kind that made one a fallen woman. Dear me! It was all very
                  difficult. One of those queerer than queer vexations that big folk appeared to hug
                  to their breasts as jealously as jewels. All I could do about it was to study
                  Ella. But that also failed in any way to enlighten my darkness. Ella still
                  remained just a woman with a broom. A tall, angry, awkward figure, sweeping out
                  the kitchen, as no doubt, she would have liked to sweep away the ugly past. She
                  was so fierce about it. Something sticky evaded the broom—it looked suspiciously
                  like a crushed raisin. ‘Papa, you might watch where you step!’ cried my Magdalene,
                  attacking the offending object with broad toe. Then she reddened and laughed, a
                  chilly ripple of sound that reminded me of hail, and, seizing the broom more
                  firmly, swept and swept and swept.</p>
               <p>Thinking it over, that night, as I hung out of the window, harking
                  to my frogs, I reached the conclusion that a fallen woman was nothing but a girl
                  who had lost her laugh—as I had once lost my voice—and made such ugly noises to
                  ease the fright in her heart.</p>
               <p>Other, more pleasant, fancies, dated back to the Selkirk scene. It
                  was there I heard my first light opera. I suspect that the amateur performers were
                  neither good nor beautiful. They were all like angels to me! Brilliant beings,
                  whose every gesture and burst of song lifted my heart a little nearer the gates of
                  a glorious heaven. The theme, ever popular with Scandinavian scribes, depicted the
                  amours and adventures of a pair of wandering students on the trail of romance. In
                  his everyday existence one of the heroes was the village baker, but, striding the
                  stage, dressed in spotless white and with a flowing cravat under his chin, I
                  thought the archangels would have to look to their harps and haloes when he
                  applied for a role in the celestial choir. Many fine singers have shattered my
                  ear-drums since then, and not one of them can hold a fig to my little baker, who
                  keeps right on carolling on some tiny stage tucked away in the cockles of my
                  heart.</p>
               <p>Another sort of play affected me profoundly. The terrifying dream
                  world of the mad. How I came to be picking flowers in the field outside the insane
                  asylum I cannot remember. Even the children who took me there are misty and
                  unreal. All except their voices.</p>
               <p>‘That’s the crazy house!’ some one bawled, pointing to a huge
                  building enclosed by a high iron fence. ‘Where they put the people with no sense
                  in their heads.’</p>
               <p>Followed then the hair-raising tale of the lunatic who tried to
                  make a soup of his doctor. Huddled in the high prairie grass, with tiger-lilies
                  like flaming swords at our backs, we listened to the story.</p>
               <p>‘You see, it was this way,’ Tommy began, swelling with importance,
                  as became one whose aunt worked in such a dangerous place. ‘This here man wasn’t
                  crazy, except in spots. That’s the kind that works round the kitchen and laundry
                  and such. But shucks! Aunty says you can’t ever tell when they’ll go off like a
                  rocket. Anyway, this here guy sees the doctor coming into the kitchen, looking for
                  some one, just as he was filling a big pot with boiling water. Just like that, it
                  happened. The luny looks at the doctor, and back at the pot. “See here,” he said,
                  “there’s gotta be better soup. The stuff we’ve been getting has no flavour—no
                  delicate flavour!” That’s exactly what he said,’ Tommy interrupted himself to
                  assure us. ‘You can ask Aunt Sigga if it isn’t. Well, I guess it was worse,
                  because the doctor was kind of fat. “Ha! ha! ha!” laughed the crazy man, “I see
                  you’re a bright fellow, and understand the situation. Be so good as to climb on a
                  chair. I don’t want to be rough. Would you rather be peppered or salted?” ’</p>
               <p>It would, it seems, have been useless to appeal for help to the
                  only other inmate of the kitchen—a feeble-minded woman whom the least excitement
                  sent into fits. The doctor used his nimble wits.</p>
               <p>‘The idea is splendid!’ he approved. ‘Absolutely remarkable!’ And
                  he cheerfully agreed that, very likely, his plumpish person would flavour the soup
                  to a king’s taste. There was one thing against it, however, a really serious
                  thing, which, if not remedied, would easily spoil the broth. He reeked of
                  medicine! Nor was it just his clothes. The nasty stuff had penetrated to his very
                  skin. The only safe and sensible thing was to tub himself thoroughly from top to
                  toe in a special solution which he kept in the bathroom.</p>
               <p>The lunatic heard him gravely. ‘You won’t run away, I suppose?’ he
                  suggested, a worried gleam in his eye. ‘It’s time we had some decent soup, you
                  know.’</p>
               <p>‘That’s why we must make sure,’ the doctor attested impressively,
                  and thus made his escape.</p>
               <p>Skin a-prickle, we crept to the fence, hoping to witness some
                  untoward happening in that topsy-turvy domain, while Tommy regaled us with still
                  other astonishing incidents.</p>
               <p>‘What makes you crazy?’ a shrill, girlish treble inquired, after we
                  had shuddered to hear how a woman had leaped from an upper window because she
                  thought she could fly. ‘What makes you crazy, Tommy?’</p>
               <p>Tommy answered with pious scorn. ‘Huh! There’s things you shouldn’t
                  understand—especially girls!’ said he. ‘ ’Tain’t good for you, see?’</p>
               <p>No, I did not see! What possible benefit could any one derive from
                  the existence of things forbidden to the understanding? Tommy was a little fool I
                  thought, little guessing how often, in the years to come other pious souls were to
                  express a similar predilection for a spineless moral code. I was cross with poor
                  Tommy for taking such a lofty stand—he was just a silly boy showing off! Yet I
                  found myself thinking of his infuriating logic, when, some weeks later I saw a
                  child with hideously crippled feet, and overheard a woman speaking of the
                  infirmity as ‘an affliction of God, too deep for human understanding’.</p>
               <p>Selkirk was not destined to contribute much more to my slowly
                  growing store of understanding. Like every other attempt to transplant us to the
                  land, it was never more than an abortive effort. Two disagreeable incidents which
                  happened in quick succession hastened our departure. One afternoon, when mother
                  was winding a skein of wool from my unwilling wrists, we were startled by the
                  sound of angry voices. Hurrying to the window, we saw that four men were thrashing
                  about in the marsh, filling the peaceful air with shouts and curses. A drunken
                  brawl, thought mamma, and, telling me to hold out my arms, went on winding the
                  yarn. A brawl it certainly was, but as the minutes passed it began to assume a
                  more serious aspect. It began to look like the assault of three determined
                  brigands upon an innocent wayfarer. Mamma was horrified.</p>
               <p>‘God help us, what can we do?’ she cried. ‘They are beating the man
                  to death. . . .’</p>
               <p>Whether dead or stunned, it was a nasty sight to see the poor
                  creature dragged away into the bush by his erstwhile companions. Yet I think mamma
                  would have dismissed the whole thing as just another Indian roughhouse if, fifteen
                  to twenty minutes later, she had not seen the same three men emerge from the woods
                  and rush pell-mell down the road.</p>
               <p>Brother was working in the village; there was nothing for it but to
                  trail baby and me to our next neighbour in the hope that that eccentric mortal
                  might for once eschew his own peccadillos and go fetch the proper authorities. It
                  was a vain hope. Flushed and excited, we arrived at the farmhouse just as another
                  bitter conflict was approaching stalemate. Mr. and Mrs. Farmer were not on
                  speaking terms. The house was in a state of siege, with madam loudly declaiming
                  that God-so-witness she was done with male oppression and evil tantrums. Never in
                  the world would she appeal to that creature she had married for anything
                  whatsoever. Not though the blessed Queen herself were being strangled would she
                  ask that toad for assistance. Not she! Moreover, mamma would find that all human
                  appeals were unavailing in that quarter.</p>
               <p>The prospect was cloudy, to say the least! No less determined than
                  his fiery spouse, the farmer had retired to the hay-loft with his trusty pipe,
                  resolved upon the first sit-down strike in the Dominion. If his wife refused to
                  behave as a Christian woman should towards her lord and master, he had no
                  intention of earning her bread in the sweat of his brow! That was the gist of the battle, or so we gathered from the
                  angry lady. ‘You needn’t expect help from that mule,’ she concluded her tirade
                  with a sniff. ‘He’ll set in that barn till his stomach hits his teeth, so he will,
                  the creature!’</p>
               <p>Sharp humour lighted mamma’s eyes. ‘Jaja! That may be so, but on
                  the other hand John may welcome a turn with the sheriff. Anyway now I’m here he
                  may as well be told.’</p>
               <p>So down to the barn we trekked, led by the militant housewife,
                  whose shrill voice muttered anathemas upon God’s masterpiece. The ill-conditioned
                  hulks of passion! Well, she had warned us. If we came to shame begging help of
                  that stubborn brute it was not her doing—she had warned us thrice three times!</p>
               <p>‘John! John!’ mamma called, making her voice as cheerful and
                  ingratiating as possible, ‘I’d like a word with you friend. It is important and no
                  doubt you will help me.’</p>
               <p>Long seconds passed with neither sound nor sign of life from the
                  loft. The baby cheeped and pulled at mamma’s hair and mamma, stifling inward
                  laughter, tried again: ‘John, John, are you there?’</p>
               <p>‘Ha-ha! what did I tell you?’ sneered the husfru, scooping up a handful of pebbles, which she flung with fierce
                  delight against the gable. ‘Now listen up there!’ she shouted, ‘I’m not asking you
                  to talk, you cockroach. It’s Mrs. Goodman, with a tale of murder—you might act like a man, not a jackass, to a neighbour!’</p>
               <p>A red, angry face, crowned with upstanding mouse-coloured hair to
                  which bits of hay imparted a comical aspect, appeared in the opening above us. ‘I
                  ain’t aiming to truck with no females!’ roared the master. ‘Murder or no
                  murder—which ain’t likely to be murder anyhow—I’m setting where I be. That’s for
                  any one to understand as has ears to hear.’</p>
               <p>‘But, John, a man was beaten into insensibility before my own
                  eyes,’ mamma appealed. ‘Even if he isn’t dead he was dragged into the bush and
                  left there helpless. Surely something should be done about it. At least it ought
                  to be reported to the sheriff,’ she tried to reason with the human hornet.</p>
               <p>‘Master in my own house, that’s what I’ll be—no more, no less,’ was
                  his retort, ‘you can tell that where you like, Mrs. Goodman, MASTER in my OWN
                  house. . . .’</p>
               <p>Obviously there was no appealing to Caesar, so mamma decided to
                  search the woods herself. The farmer’s wife, who had broken into almost tender
                  chuckles while her husband roared out his lungs, instantly pronounced herself
                  ready to assist. But first we must have coffee, and the precious little baby a
                  mash of sweetened bread! Of course we must. . . . If the man was dead he’d still
                  be dead—if he wasn’t, God would keep him safe if life was to be the poor
                  creature’s portion. Coffee we must have, and then she’d help carry the blessed
                  infant. ‘Ja, that I will,’ she attested, ‘for it ain’t pants that make a man, nor
                  a loud roar that gives heart to a mouse,’ she finished, tossing the challenge like
                  a brick back over her shoulder as the three of us made for the house.</p>
               <p>Our search of the wood was not successful. We came upon a man’s
                  badly torn coat and battered hat, but no sign of the man himself. This was added
                  confirmation that something really serious had taken place, so mamma thought.</p>
               <p>As soon as brother had finished his supper that night she sent him
                  post-haste back to the village to notify the sheriff. That worthy dismissed the
                  whole affair as a lot of silly women’s chatter. Besides, every one ought to know
                  that half-breed squabbles didn’t warrant troubling the Queen’s Constabulary—they
                  were common as fleas on a cur’s back and no more important!</p>
               <p>The second incident to hasten our flight was of a more personal
                  implication. It happened on a drizzly afternoon some few days later. Mother, for
                  once not occupied with some task, was sitting in the kitchen, which formed an
                  ‘ell’ that gave out upon a long veranda. She had the baby in her lap and
                  everything was peaceful and serene. Suddenly a heavy stumbling step was heard and
                  simultaneously a cry from mamma brought me to my feet. Glancing from her blanching
                  face to the open door, on which her startled gaze was riveted, I beheld a really
                  terrifying sight. A tall, drunken half-breed, with a cudgel and a coil of rope in
                  his hands, stood on the veranda steps, and as it seemed to me, completely blotted
                  out the golden light of the setting sun with his huge menacing bulk. Fortunately
                  for us, he appeared to waver uncertainly, as though he were wondering how he had
                  come to this strange place and what to do about it.</p>
               <p>‘Lock the door!’ Mamma’s voice fell like a whip behind me.
                  ‘Quickly! do you hear?’ I was accustomed to obedience—I would have jumped headlong
                  into the bottomless pit at that sharp command. On legs that shook like jelly I
                  streaked to the yawning door and just managed to shoot the bolt as the hideous
                  creature pounced upon the screen, yanked the hook loose, and cursing blue rivers
                  began a thunder of blows that threatened to rend the worm-eaten panels.</p>
               <p>It was not a pleasant moment, yet I doubt whether it would have
                  frightened me so badly if mamma’s obvious terror had not turned my blood to ice.
                  Never had I seen such a look of fear in her eyes or known her to sit in helpless
                  inactivity. She was like a dead person endowed with frightening speech. I flew
                  about at her behest, shoving knives into windows, barricading all the flimsy
                  doors. All of which would have been useless if our visitor had been less drunk. As
                  it was he went raging and roaring round the house, using fists and feet in blind
                  anger, but mercifully never thought of breaking the unscreened windows. It must
                  have been upwards of an hour before he wearied of his pastime, and muttering
                  darkly staggered away into the bush, leaving us to a peace that henceforward would
                  never be rid of his shadow.</p>
               <p>This experience, which to my hardy pioneering aunts would have
                  occasioned little or no distress, was so disturbing to mamma that it put an
                  effectual end to father’s utopian dream of Selkirk.</p>
               <p>That same evening she wrote a letter which must have been a sharp
                  decisive ultimatum. At any rate, the packing began in the morning, and I overheard
                  mamma telling brother that she meant to leave so soon as the last cup was safely
                  wrapped! Which we did—leaving the stuff to be watched through the night by Uncle
                  Jacob. It seemed a rather silly and headlong flight, and yet it so happened that
                  mamma’s nervous foreboding was not altogether unfounded. Whether or not it was the
                  same half-breed, with his cronies, who returned to rob the house, we had no way of
                  telling. But the fact remains that Uncle Jacob, a huge amiable giant of a man
                  whose wits were slow but his fists formidable, was roused from sleep by the
                  shrieking noise of splintering wood. Uncle jumped to his feet and, seizing an iron
                  crowbar which he had taken for a bedfellow, prepared to lay about him. Five
                  exulting savages burst into the room, little dreaming that anything save welcome
                  loot awaited their pleasure. ‘Ja, well, I don’t like to be cruel,’ Uncle Jacob
                  excused himself, ‘that crowbar he hits pretty hard, I guess. In the dark you can’t
                  be so careful if heads get in the way. Ja, well, I dragged the poor critters out
                  on the porch. Then I yust pull the stove in front of the door and sleep some
                  more. . . .’</p>

               <head>False Security</head>
               <p>Well, back we went to Winnipeg, to a colourless existence bounded
                  by narrow enclosing walls; back to the drab streets with their ugly unimaginative
                  houses and the dreary procession of plodding humanity bent upon its furtive
                  scramble for bread—back to a leaden backwash of life where the one touch of beauty
                  was the remote, incorruptible sky. For the time being papa was hopelessly beaten,
                  outwardly humble and apologetic. However, no rebuff of circumstances could quite
                  obliterate the wanderlust in his soul. His was not a circumspect heart. Never for
                  its own sake would he prize security. When he held forth upon the merits of
                  country existence he was merely arguing for a happier compromise with the evils of
                  material necessity. What he wanted was leisure to develop his social instincts,
                  for he had a genuine interest in human affairs and a natural gift for friendly
                  intercourse. Like every other frustrated dreamer since time began, he longed for
                  the kind of life which permitted of individual expression and the full enjoyment
                  of beauty.</p>
               <p>That he should have associated such a happy state with the country
                  was not surprising. By now he had come to idealize the easy-going life his own
                  father had led at Ferry-Cot, wilfully setting aside the prods of less sweet
                  memory. Upon which point mamma was sometimes moved to elaborate with unflattering
                  inference. She, at least, had not forgotten those early years in Iceland where the
                  exercise of even a fragment of this new-blown zeal for the land would have yielded
                  reasonable fruit—nor had she forgotten Dakota, where the wolves were left to
                  gobble up the lambs while papa exchanged courtesies and wisdom with some
                  addlepated neighbour. Not infrequently she drove home the shaft by adding: ‘I’ve
                  not the least doubt you’d make a capital farmer, dear Lars—if whist and toddy were
                  the tricks of the trade.’</p>
               <p>Yes, for the time being poor papa seemed utterly defeated. The old
                  life was resumed, in a house that was perhaps, a bit shabbier, but otherwise not
                  unlike the one we had left. Brother Minty, like so many other immigrant boys,
                  although highly sensitive and eager for learning, was forced to leave school and
                  find some sort of job to help out with the growing expenses. It was not merely a
                  struggle but a genuine miracle that kept our humble home intact. How mamma managed
                  to feed us even one satisfactory meal a day, let alone finding clothes which were
                  always clean and reasonably neat, is an abiding mystery. She was, of course, an
                  expert needle-woman and an indefatigable worker. Our garments were not only made
                  and re-made, but turned and so often dyed that the Lord Himself would have been
                  puzzled to know their original status. Skirts turned into jackets, jackets into
                  pants, pants into bed-quilts, and bed-quilts into braided mats for the floor. All
                  our mitts, socks, and stockings she knitted by hand; so, too, scarfs and mufflers.
                  These were her pleasant pastimes! At such occupations she was not only a wizard of
                  speed, but supremely happy. For thus engaged she might sit and spin a yarn for
                  eager youngsters, or read a tattered book without the least guilt upon her
                  conscience. Many were the tales she told to the lonely immigrant youngsters who
                  adopted our open house for want of better pleasure. But then mamma was
                  past-mistress in that ancient Viking art. Her yarning was not a haphazard
                  narration of disjointed incidents but a colourful recital of vital events that
                  progressed by logical stages to a fitting end. Nor were there any forgotten
                  strands which she must arrest the tale to recapture. Mamma would have blushed for
                  shame at such a stupid exhibition of muddle-headedness; ‘Oh, I forgot, I should
                  have mentioned so-and-so’ did not occur in mamma’s story-telling. Her memory was
                  keen and unclouded and her sense of the dramatic almost perfect. She not so much
                  told her tale as lived it, and she could imitate voices and emulate moods as
                  expertly as an actress.</p>
               <p>These sagas were our chief entertainment—usually topped off with
                  hot pancakes (which mamma tossed together quick as a wink when the last tear was
                  shed) and lots of coffee. These pancakes, made with flour and water, one egg and a
                  dash of nutmeg, were, like the knitting, a source of joy and pride to mamma. They
                  were thin as tissue paper and must be fried on a special griddle—to touch which
                  for lesser purposes was a heinous crime in our house. They were greaseless,
                  sprinkled with sugar, rolled into golden sheaves, and eaten red hot. They were
                  justly famous, for after thirty years of prayerful attempt to create anything like
                  them I acknowledge utter defeat! Other Icelandic housewives made excellent
                  pancakes, with the help of several eggs and milk, but only mamma, to my knowledge,
                  had the knack of creating this trickiest of titbits with water and one egg. ‘Oh,
                  well, you see,’ she used to say, ‘there is nothing to boast of in cooking a fine
                  dish with everything to hand. A fool could do that!’ The inference was plain. To
                  this day I look with suspicion upon a two-egg recipe and with pity upon any one
                  who succumbs to such a snare and delusion.</p>
               <p>So these were our delicacies. The staple fare consisted of
                  flatbread, soup, rice, and porridge. Since there was never enough money for more
                  than one substantial meal this had to be the soup. For as you may guess, then the
                  pot boasted a joint of beef as well as turnips, potatoes, and an onion! Sometimes
                  the stock was thickened with a dash of oatmeal—which seemed to me a crime against
                  the soul of soup, but mamma held more with nourishment than aesthetic vapours.
                  Except for prunes and dried figs, which at that time had not come into the popular
                  cuisine and were therefore cheap, and might be indulged in on state occasions, I
                  had not seen a bit of fruit in our house since the winter when dear Doctor Chown
                  used to leave an apple or orange in my sick hands. Well, with one memorable
                  exception: I was bribed with an enormous orange to submit to vaccination. If I
                  were good and didn’t cry I should have this prize of the gods. But, alas, when the
                  ordeal ended I found I was honourably bound to share my bribe with the unwounded
                  members of the family!</p>
               <p>On the whole we were rather cheerful, despite our draughty house
                  and meagre fare. The gospel of balanced diet had not as yet been preached. None of
                  us suspected that life owed us grape-fruit and tomato juice. When in very bad
                  times papa was too ill to work throughout the week, we did without eggs in the
                  pancakes, turnips in the soup, milk in the coffee, and boasted that, after all,
                  three dollars had done the work of six. Seemingly we were sublimely unaware that
                  when toothache wracked us and colds kept us shivering beside the kitchen stove, a
                  dash of calcium—like the nutmeg in mamma’s pancakes—would have lifted the flat
                  feeling and given us a more lively tang. Of course, we knew that good food was
                  highly enjoyable—we might even have conceded that upon high occasions such as
                  weddings, wakes, and christenings it was really essential—but if you could not
                  have it on a budget of dimes you hid the fact behind a stack of flatbread, so to
                  speak. You stuffed on starches and thanked your stars it was so filling. Besides,
                  to quote mamma: food couldn’t be so extremely important, since most of the human
                  race had to get by on so little of it!</p>
               <p>Well, as I said before, we had settled down to the old penny-pinch
                  grind, moderately convinced that Winnipeg was our destined battle-ground. Mamma
                  really appeared to think that the ghost of papa’s dream was successfully laid. For
                  weeks not a word had been said about the glorious inspiration of the rural scene
                  or the necessity for man to be in close and loving contact with nature. Why, papa
                  had suddenly developed such a streak of practical good sense that he had gone
                  rummaging in a junk shop and found a sewing-machine which, because of various
                  mechanical defects, he was able to purchase for three dollars—in two equal
                  payments! It was a hopeless-looking object when it landed in the kitchen, but when
                  papa had finished overhauling its insides and varnishing its outsides we all
                  agreed that it gave the entire house a flattering touch of scientific progress.
                  This opinion was strengthened when the old machine went into action; it ate its
                  way through the thickest quilting as easily as the prairie sun eats into a
                  snowbank—even leather was no obstacle. And what a voice it had! At its best, when
                  mamma’s busy feet were racing up and down the paddle, it roared and thundered
                  without ceasing, setting up an awesome reverberation in every crook and cranny.
                  Papa had certainly redeemed himself! What was more, his depressing humility had
                  given place to normal wit and humour. Once more we heard lively bits of gossip
                  from the shop, or sat with rapt attention while papa read for us some article or
                  essay he had just finished in those precious Sunday hours. Peace, if not plenty,
                  reigned in our house; we began to have the smugly settled feeling which goes with
                  the firm conviction that the skillet hangs on the third hook behind the stove;
                  that one’s Sunday dress hangs in a moth bag in the left-hand corner of the
                  clothes-press; that the extra pair of sheets are in the second bureau drawer, and
                  that the bureau itself can be located even in the dark.</p>
               <p>Then the thunderbolt struck. Papa had made up his mind again. This
                  time we were going to the United States of America! More specifically, our
                  destination was Duluth, Minnesota, where papa’s sister was successfully
                  established as a midwife, and was already contemplating building a nursing-home.
                  Oh, well, we might have known that our domestic brig would never lie for long in
                  untroubled water. Moreover, we should have sniffed the rising wind when papa
                  turned from serious criticism to lively satire—when, instead of a diatribe on the
                  feebleness of modern poetry and modern poets, he amused himself with a satiric
                  hyperbole on Napoleon’s satin breeches. Indeed, we might have been warned, for
                  satire, contrary to popular belief, springs from a cheerful heart. If papa made
                  scathing fun of his favourite adventurer it was because in his innermost being he
                  was drawing closer to the beacon fire that feeds the quenchless hunger of such
                  avid souls.</p>
               <p>As a matter of actual fact my incorrigible papa had been exorcizing
                  his demon by writing passionate epistles to Aunt Haldora. He had poured out his
                  tale of frustration to such good effect that not only was his own heart purged of
                  gloom but that of his sceptical sister filled with resolute pity. It was
                  unthinkable that her dear brother should languish in such a wretched country for
                  ever—especially when Ingiborg was so pig-headed. That’s what came of having
                  knights for ancestors. Thank heaven, the worst she had to live down was a
                  lascivious friar and a musty bishop! Oh, she knew that papa had often acted like a
                  fool, but now he must pull himself together and make a fresh start. He must not
                  show the fleece of a silly ram and continue ba-ba-ing and bleating. There was no
                  earthly reason why he should keep on killing himself in the service of a miserly
                  money grubber! Canada wasn’t much of a country anyhow. So far as she had been able
                  to make out, not even the English thought of it in favourable light. It was
                  nothing but the hapless hunting ground for misbegotten upstarts who dreamt of easy
                  fortunes with which to dazzle other fools back home. Now, in the United States it
                  was altogether different. Even the stupidest foreigner quickly perceived that his
                  ultimate success depended upon a whole-hearted acceptance of American ideals and
                  American citizenship. In other words, wrote my aunt, the United States was a
                  self-respecting country—not just the tail-hair of the British Bulldog! What was
                  more it availed you nothing down there to brag about Trafalgar Square, the
                  Buckingham Palace Guard, and Queen Victoria’s virtue. The United States offered
                  you a chance to prove yourself, not what had impelled your
                  ancestors at the siege of Malta, or in the golden age of the Vikings.</p>
               <p>All of which, reduced to its ultimate challenge, implied that if
                  papa had an ounce of initiative left he would at once set about returning to the
                  Great Republic. Not to go mooning about coyotes this time, but to work like a
                  sensible man at his decent craft, where decent wages were paid.</p>
               <p>‘And that’s exactly what I mean to do,’ said papa, waving his
                  epistle in mamma’s astonished face. ‘You can say what you like, Ingiborg. Sister
                  is right—I’d be a fool to let my children grow up in a country where the people
                  haven’t any interest in their national destiny—as a matter of fact I have sold the
                  cow.’</p>
               <p>Which qualifying statement, and not the national indifference of
                  the so-called Canadians, was, I suspect, the decisive factor in mamma’s swift
                  surrender—or perhaps she had known all along that, cheated of his country
                  paradise, papa must, inevitably, seek some palliative substitute.</p>

               <head>The American Scene Opens</head>
               <p>In due course we arrived at my aunt’s comfortable house in Duluth
                  and were well received, as was to be expected of that most hospitable of
                  relatives. The house itself impressed me little at the time, for my aunt was such
                  an overwhelming individual that everything else dwindled into insignificance
                  before her. If ever a human being was magnificently clothed in her unique
                  personality it was Aunt Haldora. Everything about her was large: her ungainly
                  figure, which for all its bulk moved with dignity and surprising lightness; her
                  head, with its fine broad brow and penetrating grey eyes, behind which one sensed
                  a brain in keeping with this imposing character—and indeed in her thinking there
                  was no room whatever for the petty meannesses and irrelevant trifles which
                  constitute so large a part of the average female’s mental gymnastics. For gossip
                  and small talk she had no taste, and this indifference to insignificant details
                  was extended to all those unimportant matters that clutter up most people’s lives.
                  There were no useless knick-knacks begging care in her severe house, which
                  breathed wholesome comfort and cleanliness and an immense peace. I use the word
                  advisedly; nothing else explains the feeling that swept away your preoccupation
                  whenever you entered there—a feeling of being cut loose from cramped moorings and
                  set adrift on a large quiet body of waters.</p>
               <p>Presiding at her table, Aunt Haldora seemed to me a figure out of a
                  Viking legend: impersonal, cold, but sincerely concerned with the fate and
                  fortunes of her ragged, impecunious guests. She inquired after our health, thought
                  we looked under-nourished, and predicted that our starchy pallor would soon fade
                  when papa had established us in this civilized country. She admired the baby,
                  which had been named after her, and also predicted that, unlike myself, it had
                  promise of good looks. I had nice hair, to be sure, but it ought to be cut, she
                  said—so much hair on a puny girl ate up the vital energy for nothing. It was all
                  well meant, but created in me an extremely painful awareness of insufficiency—made
                  me feel that I was one of those unnecessary encumbrances that burden the earth. I
                  did not resent this implied criticism of my worthless person, for it was so
                  self-evident that never in this or any other world could I hope to attain to the
                  magnificent stature of my aunt, or clutch for my own such unshakable self-esteem.
                  I was ashamed to sit and stare at her in stupid silence, but what else could I
                  do?</p>
               <p>Every gesture of her really beautiful, well-kept hands fascinated
                  me. The curt way she spoke, which brooked no doubts nor opposition, was a
                  revelation in forcefulness. Everything she did and everything she thought and
                  everything she expressed in words was so firmly fixed in a sense of absolute
                  perfection, according to her lights, that even the most foolish person realized
                  the futility of opposition. That she was an autocrat in every sense of the word is
                  certainly true—but the sort of autocrat who rigidly abides by, and at all costs
                  maintains a moral code predestined for a certain cast by an all-wise deity. She
                  was utterly sincere and utterly without vanity. Her person, like her house, was
                  dedicated to service. Her clothes were clinically severe; the only ornament she
                  permitted herself was a velvet band that she always wore about her neck. I think
                  she even slept with it. Her whole life was centred in her profession, of which she
                  was justly proud. And, unlike most married women who dabble in professionalism,
                  she had the good sense to leave the details of housekeeping to others. That was
                  not her business. Often enough she was cheated in the kitchen, where a wasteful
                  cook might happen to rule at the moment. Well, what of that? Such people knew no
                  better! That phrase, more than any other, sums up my aunt’s character. With all
                  her heart she believed that ‘the lower orders’ were as God had made them. How
                  foolish, therefore, to expect any sort of perfection from the poor creatures. She
                  would as soon have blamed a crow for not singing sweetly as find fault with the
                  stupidity or moral flabbiness of an individual whose racial inheritance was
                  suspect. Conversely, she was critical and severe and alert for signs of shameful
                  weakness in those who ought, in themselves and their behaviour, to be a credit to
                  a decent family.</p>
               <p>Naturally, I did not understand any of this at the time. But I
                  certainly felt that, in addition to resembling my mother’s people rather than her
                  own, which she could hardly help thinking a sad misfortune, I was not a
                  promising-looking shoot of an ancient, though somewhat sin-gnarled, branch. Fixing
                  her clear grey eyes upon my abashed countenance, which had nothing whatever to
                  commend it, she expressed the hope that I would take kindly to school, and brushed
                  aside with a wave of her capable hand my mother’s explanation that ill health, not
                  dullness, had kept me at home so far. ‘No matter,’ said my aunt curtly, ‘she will
                  have to start now. She will be all the better for having something to think about
                  beside these silly notions. I must say I am surprised at you, Ingiborg, coddling a
                  great girl into believing she is sick! What do you say, child, wouldn’t you really
                  like to start school like a sensible creature?’</p>
               <p>Indeed I would! I wanted to shout, but, instead, only nodded my
                  head, turning red as a beetroot. It was a thrilling thought, which excited and
                  scared me into a fever of anxiety. I wanted nothing quite so much and yet I shook
                  in my shoes when I pictured in my mind what the experience would entail. I was
                  nearly ten years old, and, except for a few words and phrases picked up from my
                  brother, understood nothing of English. And I was so shy that even an innocent
                  glance from a stranger threw me into such profound confusion that my mind seemed
                  to go soft as putty. What was worse, I realized thoroughly what a fool I looked at
                  such times—how utterly stupid my behaviour was to others.</p>
               <p>The prospect of this much-desired, though terrifying, adventure
                  seems to have absorbed me so completely that I have no recollection of just how or
                  when we moved into a hideous barn of a house, one of a dozen project houses that
                  occupied a block of treeless, unimproved land. Everything in the immediate
                  neighbourhood was ugly, with the one exception of the big brick schoolhouse, which
                  was handsomely situated upon the side of a sharply inclined hill. It was a fine
                  modern building, boasting a square tower that stood out boldly against the grey
                  skies, like the turret of some medieval castle that commands a squalid town.</p>
               <p>Squalid in every respect was this American counterpart of the
                  frontier town we had just quitted. There wasn’t a splinter to chose between them!
                  The same ugly, hastily erected houses offended the eye; the same unkempt streets
                  and dirty alleys despoiled an otherwise decent plain. We still fetched water from
                  a pump that rose like an iron-wraith from an oozy grave. The same sort of rigs
                  rattled over the ruts and the same sort of humdrum humanity hurried by. Nothing in
                  the adjacent environs enlisted wonder or inspired the imagination. We had not even
                  the remote beauty of the flawless prairie skies on which to fix our searching
                  hearts.</p>
               <p>Here in the Lake Superior country grey clouds, gloomy and
                  low-lying, obscured the sun hours on end, and by night spread a blanket of mist
                  over the stars. The weather was cold and depressing; dank winds, like the breath
                  of a corpse, blew from off the huge sheet of frigid water, congealing the marrow
                  in my bones; rain pounded from the leaden skies, to rush in brown rivers through
                  deep gutters. All in all it was a disheartening beginning to a decade which, as my
                  aunt predicted, was yet to prove reasonably filled with contentment, and
                  productive of the only security our wandering household was ever to know. But in
                  those first trying months it was difficult even to dream of such an eventuality.
                  To begin with, our resources were so straitened that I suspect mamma went to bed
                  on black coffee most of the time. Father was still in Winnipeg, you see, working
                  off our fares and saving for his own. What he could send us out of the pittance
                  paid him at the saddlery was so incredibly small that to mention the sum would
                  lead my dearest friends to suspect me. Not even a relief recipient would believe
                  me! Yet the rent was paid. We somehow managed to buy oil for the lamp and slabs
                  for the kitchen stove. There were no sugared pancakes, however, nor turnips to
                  flavour the thin oatmeal soup. Still, mamma managed to be cheerful—very cheerful,
                  let me say, when, on rare occasions, my aunt had the time to drive by in her neat
                  buggy drawn by a stout bay mare, never stopping long, but always anxious to know
                  how we fared, when papa was expected to arrive, and what progress I was making in
                  school. Mamma was often lonely, I suspect, for now there were no Icelandic
                  youngsters to run in for a yarn; no band-boys to bring down the rafter with
                  rollicking marches. Brother had found a few young friends of whom mother had no
                  high opinion, being as she was a very clannish Norsewoman who wished to know the
                  history of your family at least to the fourth generation before she felt easy in
                  her mind as to what your reactions to the possible temptations of this vale of
                  tears might reasonably be expected to be. I was away in school, fighting my own
                  peculiar battles; she had only the baby, her weekly letter from papa, and her
                  thoughts, which she kept to herself.</p>

            <div>
               <head>New Friends of Novel Fortune</head>
               <p>There were only two other Icelandic families in West Duluth, the
                  Halsons, and certainly they were odd enough to arouse any one’s interest. Two
                  brothers, as different as day from night, had married women of whom the same might
                  be said without a figment of exaggeration. The elder brother, whom I shall call
                  John, was a solemn priestly individual, who discovered too late that the Lord
                  intended him for scholarly pursuits and not common ordinary labour. Much too late,
                  one might say, for by now he was saddled with four hearty youngsters and a stout
                  maternal spouse, whose natural destiny had nothing to do with books. John, unlike
                  lesser men, however, had managed to strike a satisfactory compromise with his
                  fortune. He had completely converted his little hostages and his big wife to an
                  utter and passionate belief in his god-like qualities. Papa was much too good to
                  sacrifice himself to crude labour. He had withdrawn from the rigours of life, and
                  sat from dawn till dark in the warmest room in the house, surrounded by stacks of
                  papers, magazines, and tattered, paper-bound books that lined the walls almost to
                  the ceiling. ‘The lazy creature has made a perfect firetrap of that dump!’ my aunt
                  announced unfeelingly, but with wisdom, as was soon to be seen.</p>
               <p>Master John had another accomplishment. He played the organ, and
                  so, of course, somehow or other, the family had scraped up money to buy him a
                  little folding instrument, which was only used on Sundays and for family prayers.
                  For John was as religious as he was learned—his head as full of salvation as it
                  was overflowing with ill-assorted bits of information on all sorts of useless
                  subjects. But what did that matter? Papa John was an oracle to whom the whole
                  family looked with humble, adoring respect. They lived only to please him. The
                  children hunted odd jobs, my aunt rustled up clothing to cover them, and the
                  various hotels in the city gave them scraps of food.</p>
               <p>Every evening Julie, the second daughter, or Johnnie, the only son,
                  started off with a basket to gather up these scraps. Emma, the eldest daughter,
                  was never subjected to these humiliations, because it was recognized by every one
                  that she took after papa. She must be brought up like a lady, and therefore sat at
                  home doing fancy work and assisting mamma in seeing to papa’s comfort. There was
                  talk of letting her attend a business college whenever the money should be found,
                  and the inference was that my aunt would one day realize what an exceptional deed
                  of virtue such an act would be.</p>
               <p>A crazy household, some said, but, for all their queer ways, they
                  were a kindly lot, and their poor cluttered four-room house breathed genuine
                  goodwill and affection. There was not a mean streak in any one of them, nor was it
                  ever known that harsh words passed between them. Of course, Mr. Halson poked out
                  his head from that holy-of-holies now and then if the youngsters got too noisy,
                  and, like Moses on Mount Sinai, reminded his progeny that life was a serious
                  affair—had they not better see to their lessons, the empty baskets, or the
                  wood-pile?</p>
               <p>Sunday was unique in that house. No matter if they ate scraps all
                  week, on this Holy Day dedicated to God and papa there must always be hot
                  chocolate and cakes after prayers, and every one must observe the sanctified
                  proprieties. No smuggy faces, no wrinkled stockings, not a hair out of place. Even
                  the patches on Johnnie’s pants seemed to efface themselves and piously merge with
                  the original cloth of the sabbath garment.</p>
               <p>Since both Johnnie and the youngest girl were near my own age, I
                  was eagerly invited to join these solemn Sunday festivals. I surmise that Mr.
                  Halson, knowing my father through his journalism, was really concerned with my
                  spiritual health, and quite possibly thought to snatch me, a brand from the
                  burning, by the power of these blessed moments under his pious roof-tree. How
                  little he guessed the depths of my sin! How shocked he would have been to know
                  that Fia, his dearest baby, and I, had a sort of sign language by which we
                  communicated our restless thoughts to one another while we sat, meek as lambs, on
                  the hard benches that served for chairs, waiting for the inspired prophet to be
                  done with his sermon. On and on and on rolled the sonorous voice, unfolding the
                  plan of salvation and the dark destiny of sinners. Writhing on our little sterns,
                  Fia and I shaded our faces from the wrathful light of papa’s transfixed
                  countenance, and, under cover of hot little palms, mouthed a hope that the end was
                  in sight—that soon we might escape to the creek in search of minnows, for which we
                  had a passion, or up into the hills, where luscious patches of sauerkraut grass
                  offered a delicious forbidden diet.</p>
               <p>Yes, now the final stretch was come. ‘Let us join in solemn
                  prayer,’ boomed Mr. Halson. ‘Let us bare our sins to the Father of Mercies, whose
                  wrath is terrible, but His patience long-suffering.’ So down we scrambled to our
                  knees, Mrs. Halson audibly creaking in every joint, and puffing like a weary camel
                  as she settled her billowing petticoats neatly about her kneeling, corpulent form.
                  An incense of sins floated up to the Almighty, sins of the flesh and sins of the
                  mind and sins of the spirit, all properly seasoned with the spice of poetic
                  humility. And not until we lay there exposed in all our variegated iniquity, not
                  so much as a fig-leaf of vanity left to clothe us, were we permitted to rise and
                  join in a gloomy hymn.</p>
               <p>That final ordeal ended, Mr. Halson rose from the organ stool and
                  beamed upon the sinners, who, in turn, beamed back, like so many little starlets
                  suddenly freed from a smothering cloudbank. Mamma Halson, glowing with pride,
                  hurried forward to kiss the head of the house for his dear devotion, and then
                  scurried into the kitchen, where chocolate was simmering in a black iron kettle at
                  the back of the stove. All the young sinners followed suit. ‘Thank you, dear papa!
                  Thank you, dearest papa! Thank you, darling papa!’ they murmured, and were
                  solemnly kissed in return. No doubt I should have kissed the good man also, for he
                  always waited patiently for my lame little gesture, for my limp little paw that
                  hypocritically expressed the thanks I did not feel. Then, too, I was always in
                  mortal terror lest Mr. Halson, who towered over us in the awful dignity of his
                  Sunday vestments, should address me in particular, and require an honest answer.
                  From this nightmare I was always rescued, however, by the joyous voice of Mrs.
                  Halson calling from the kitchen: ‘Come, my dear ones, be so good as to partake of
                  a little refreshment!’</p>
               <p>Dear Mrs. Halson! How she gloried in that humble hospitality. How
                  eagerly she filled the cracked cups with her thick, sweetened chocolate, smiling
                  as a summer moon upon the harvest of love’s labour. Not one cup, but two, we must
                  have, and all the cake and cookies—made from the same batch with very little
                  shortening—that our stomachs could hold. To refuse a second helping would have
                  been a reflection, not only upon her cooking, but upon the goodness of her deeply
                  maternal heart. All the week long she waited for this blessed moment—for the
                  unspeakable joy of pouring out the best she had for those she loved, and whosoever
                  these precious ones called friends. In her patched alpaca and spotless white
                  apron, she stood at the head of the long table—which was made of pine boards on
                  trestles, and covered with oilcloth and a centrepiece of cotton, embroidered by
                  Emma—swelling with innocent rapture, waiting for her tithe of thanks, which was
                  willingly forthcoming when we youngsters filed from the board and kissed her
                  moist, smiling face. Yes, even the high-minded master soberly kissed his kindly
                  wife, giving her a little pat on her thick, stooping shoulders.</p>
               <p>The other Halson household was not presided over by the mistress,
                  but by her spinster sister-in-law, a small immaculate female, as crisp as a
                  baker’s bun. The mistress was a semi-invalid, a thin little woman, with a great
                  wealth of hair which she wore in braids down her back, and who limped about on a
                  crutch, swinging her withered limb with a jerky, side-wise motion that gave her
                  the air of a sloop tacking before the wind. She was an intelligent woman, given to
                  reading and needlework, and was always very cheerful, as perhaps she had cause to
                  be, since both her husband and his maiden sister looked upon her as a delicate
                  trust. Her husband, Einar Halson, was a short, apologetic person, of whom I
                  remember nothing except his shy affection for the invalid, and that he had a
                  bristling moustache which struggled vainly to impress masculine virility upon an
                  otherwise hairless and extremely meek countenance.</p>
               <p>Gossip waxed fat on this second household also. Mrs. Halson was
                  only half a wife, it was said—a statement which at that time I understood as
                  applying to her withered leg. She had peculiar haemorrhages, which were spoken of
                  in horrified whispers as a perversion of nature, for the lady was not consumptive,
                  but had suffered this periodic distress every month since puberty. But, although
                  Icelanders have no mock modesty about the human body and its functions, I was not
                  much enlightened on the mystery, even when I overheard Stina, our Gossip (of whom
                  more later), exclaim sympathetically: ‘Poor creature! It’s a cross the Good God
                  laid on her for sure. The devil knows it’s bad enough to be a woman when your
                  insides work the right way round!’</p>
               <p>Naturally, I was fascinated by Jorun Halson after that. On the few
                  occasions when she paid us a visit, swinging down the narrow sidewalk with her
                  swift, uneven gait, her neat black dress flapping against the clumsy crutch, the
                  sun picking out the soft gold of her beautiful plaits of hair, I was all agog with
                  excitement. Would the lady’s insides maintain equilibrium or would they take this
                  unhappy opportunity to display the curse of God? Would this ethereal being, whose
                  habits were such a mystery, fix upon this moment to ‘give up the ghost’, as Stina
                  predicted that she might do without warning, ‘between two breaths’?</p>
               <p>Sometimes the sister-in-law, Helga, came with the invalid, and, by
                  her tough brittleness, defeated my earnest hope. She was so attentive, so
                  watchful, so practical, with her quick attention upon draughts, and her hand ever
                  ready with a shawl for the tender shoulder of her charge, that even I understood
                  that Death himself would have a tussle to steal away her beloved. Nothing would
                  happen between two breaths unless Helga had her head turned the other way! These
                  visits had their own tang, none the less. Mrs. Halson was delightful to look at as
                  she sat with her little white hands folded in her lap, the profile of her delicate
                  face traced against the sunlit window-pane, her whispering voice filling the room
                  with an illusion of ghostly charm. For her talk was more often of marvellous
                  dreams and forebodings than of everyday matters: of a misty borderland, where the
                  spirits of men departed yet fettered to earth by ties of love or hate, mingled
                  with the souls of questing dreamers. Nor was it difficult to imagine how readily
                  the eager spirit, looking out from her clear blue eyes, would seek some such finer
                  world, where the ills of the flesh neither stay nor hamper the flying wings of
                  yearning. Her speech was gentle, all her manner restrained and resigned, yet even
                  to a child, it was manifest that the undertow of her thoughts was fierce and
                  earnest. Life had cheated her, but death would be kinder. In that far green land
                  whose bounds were illimitable and eternal, the God of the Meek and Lowly would
                  fully compensate each broken hope. Over the bitter coffee drunk to the
                  accompaniment of this Elysian murmur, I found myself catching hold of the garments
                  of Prophecy and soaring to fanciful heights. For I, too, dreamed dreams—was it
                  because my own insides were ill assorted?—and who should say that I might not one
                  day have visions, see the shining hosts that sing before God’s face, and count the
                  wheeling planets that form His living rosary? Who should gainsay that flaming
                  possibility, when little Mrs. Halson, who was scarcely a whole woman and only half
                  a wife, spoke so unerringly of the winged powers of the deathless spirit?</p>
               <p>Very different from the ethereal Mrs. Halson was Stina Olson, who
                  became a devoted friend to the family. She was a woman with a past! Hard though it
                  was to believe it, when one studied her unprepossessing person, she had had a
                  lover, of whom gossip said he was handsome, years younger than herself, and quite
                  a dandy. What puzzled me still more was the added information that this lover was
                  none other than the son of my dignified homoeopathic doctor. How any one so
                  scrupulously well behaved could have a scapegrace for a son struck me as a most
                  unrighteous state of affairs. God was much too free with his afflictions, that I
                  perceived, and shuddered in my bones.</p>
               <p>Stina had worked for the old man, so it was said, and what could
                  you expect of a spinster whose charms were flitting away as rapidly as a witch on
                  a broomstick, when she suddenly found herself alone in the house with a fledgeling
                  male as full of hungry curiosity as a mouse in a cupboard? No one was the least
                  surprised, unless it was Stina herself, when the curse of Eve came upon her. But
                  at that there were no tears. Stina was gaunt, almost toothless, and her hair was
                  colourless as dried straw, but the springs of her heart were rich in humour and
                  goodwill. What was a baby to growl about anyway? Goodness knows she hadn’t
                  expected so much of life. Without the least rancour she betook herself to other
                  quarters and cheerfully waited the blessed event. She was well rewarded. The baby
                  was a beautiful child—a dear son who never was to cause her a day’s uneasiness.
                  And she loved him as fiercely as only such a derelict can love.</p>
               <p>Now she had drifted to Duluth, and if you please, had got herself a
                  husband. A little bantam of a man, a perfect pepper-pot, always spilling over with
                  indignation at the injustices of the social order. ‘I’m a union man!’ he would
                  shout, ‘I’m a socialist—ja, let them fire me, the dirty rapscallions! I stay by
                  the union and starve, God help me!’</p>
               <p>Fired he was, from job after job, and not always because of his
                  devotion to justice. He had a weakness for the bottle that equalled his passion
                  for the rights of man. ‘Ja, well, I have to drown my grief like a hero. I have to
                  bear up somehow,’ said Sam, and shook his round head that was thatched with black
                  and white patches of tenderly nursed hair. ‘Sure, and what else,’ Stina agreed
                  cheerfully. ‘It’s a queer world, and that’s a fact. Now try a bite of herring for
                  your health’s sake.’</p>
               <p>So Sam continued to drown his grief periodically, never
                  offensively, you understand, for he was a tidy little mortal with every pinfeather
                  always neatly in place, and his peppery crowing was entirely without malice. Stina
                  kept the pot boiling by one means or another. Sometimes she lent a hand
                  house-cleaning or washing, but when we met her she was mothering another
                  rudderless soul, a huge dock-worker whose past was one long friendless buffeting.
                  If he had a surname I never knew it. Every one called him Big Tom, and big he
                  certainly was, a mountainous creature who shuffled through the world in melancholy
                  isolation. He rarely spoke, and what few words he uttered were monosyllables half
                  whispered from the corner of his mouth. He gave the unhappy impression of always
                  having existed on sufferance, and to be patiently waiting the next swift kick of
                  fortune. Sometimes, when Stina was waiting at table, hovering over him with kindly
                  anxiety, a sort of paroxysm would twist his rugged face, as though he were about
                  to cry, so strange it seemed that any one should take the least thought for his
                  comfort. Still, he never thanked her, unless these surprising grimaces and the
                  dog-like devotion of his eyes, were meant for thanks. But on payday, when he came
                  home from the docks, reeking with sweat and black as Satan, he dumbly handed out
                  his board money the moment he crossed the threshold. ‘Ja, sure, it is enough to
                  make you weep,’ Stina told my mother, weaving to and fro on her nervous feet. ‘Out
                  comes the money like I was waiting there with an axe in my hands. Now, can you
                  tell me what devilry has done the like of that to a decent creature? No you can’t!
                  God Himself will scratch His blessed Head and that’s a fact. For mind you, my
                  dearie, it isn’t just that the poor brute has no friends—neither kith nor kin nor
                  even a hussy to steal his pay—it’s like he was dead at the core. If you ask me,
                  I’d say he was killed in the cradle—ja, I’m thinking he had no mother, the poor
                  little poppet—more like she ran out on him, the wicked scullion, and left him to
                  the Devil’s jobbing!’</p>
               <p>Well, now he had found a haven. Little Sam had discovered him one
                  noon, sitting, lonely and abstracted, away from the gabbing workers who were
                  taking their midday ease. Sam, bubbling with indignation over the inequalities
                  that smirch the Lord’s footstool, thought he might discover an attentive ear in
                  that huge, silent figure. Nor was he far wrong. Little Sam bristled and barked,
                  beat his fists together, and kicked up clouds of powdered iron ore, covering
                  himself and the motionless listener with a clogging film of dust like pulverized
                  blood. Never had he enjoyed such an understanding audience! The big man sat there,
                  dim amazement slowly giving way before a vast admiration, as the bold little
                  cockerel hopped and howled. Though he said nothing, it was plain this was an
                  accomplishment for which he would gladly have exchanged a span of years. And when
                  the little Union Man finally ran out of wind, Big Tom unscrewed the top of his
                  round dinner pail and poured out a mug of brackish coffee, which he silently
                  offered for the easement of the orator’s palate. When the six o’clock whistle blew
                  clever little Sam was on hand waiting for the amiable giant, whom he adroitly
                  manœuvred into the nearest bar, and, over twin mugs of foaming beer, learned all
                  that ever could be learned of the big man’s past. He was alone in the world; had
                  always been alone in the world; he had a room near the waterfront.</p>
               <p>‘What kind of a room, my friend?’ demanded Sam. ‘Ha! I can guess
                  what they think is right for a working man—especially for a fellow who isn’t a
                  union man. Now, my wife is that clean a fly has to wipe its feet to enter through
                  a knothole. Such a nice room she has behind the kitchen, with a comfortable bed
                  you could have for next to nothing. What do you say, Big Tom? Why don’t you come
                  home with me and taste the bean soup? You won’t have to hunt for the beans in the
                  pot water, I promise you!’</p>
               <p>‘Ja, that was the way of it,’ Stina informed us, and giggled, as
                  she was wont to do at at the end of every sentence. ‘He came slinking in with Sam,
                  the big ninny, and, let me tell you, he took some feeding to get the green look
                  off his bones.’</p>
               <p>Stina was our most frequent visitor while we lived in that
                  desolate, barn-like house near the school. Always out of breath from unnecessary
                  haste, whatever the weather, her starched print dress billowing in the endless
                  wind, she blew into the house puffing and giggling, her small son neat as a doll,
                  trotting behind her. ‘God give you health! How are you? Wouldn’t you think the
                  Holy One would quiet the wind! Don’t tell me it was ever worse in Iceland. . . .
                  Bless my soul is that the same baby? Now don’t screw your mug up, my angel, it’s
                  just old Stina taking note of the new inches. Kiss the baby, Valdi, like a good
                  boy, and behave yourself, my rabbit!’</p>
               <p>That was our Stina, the cheerful sinner who refused to be burdened
                  with a sense of shame for her stolen escapade on the primrose highway. She was
                  always welcome, but I remember one bitterly cold autumn day, with iron rain
                  sleeting the windows, when her sudden appearance was nothing short of a miracle.
                  For some reason, papa’s slim allowance had not reached us, and all that day mamma
                  had beguiled our hunger with tall tales of heroic splendour, washed down with cups
                  of hot water. Stirring tales, to be sure, but somehow or other my spongy spirit
                  kept veering, like a rudderless skiff, from the fine feats of the ancestors to the
                  gratifying vision of flatbread and butter. Mamma grew a little sharp. ‘Listen
                  here, my lamb, there are worse things than an empty stomach! An empty head, for
                  instance! Would you like to hear the story of the Twelve Wild Ducks?’</p>
               <p>Well, of course that would be nice, I admitted, with a dampish
                  sniffle. Though to tell the truth, I wondered a little that I should even have
                  thought the tale fascinating. Yes, now it struck me that the queen whose woe it
                  was to have twelve sons and no daughter might well have restrained her tears. The
                  little princelings had all the pigeon-pie they wanted. But there it was—the silly
                  woman moped and moaned, and finally pricked her royal finger, the red blood
                  dropping to the white snow outside her window. ‘Oh, that I had a daughter with
                  cheeks so white and rosy!’ cried she, completely forgetting the bounty of her
                  bouncing sons. And instantly up pops an ugly creature from nowhere with precious
                  comfort. ‘Give me your sons,’ says the horrid thing, leering like a drunken
                  turtle, ‘and you shall have your heart’s desire—the fairest in the world.’</p>
               <p>‘Really?’ cries the queen. ‘Well, take the little brats! I’m sick
                  to death of keeping tab on all their boots and buttons——’</p>
               <p>So here we were, off to a good start, with the princess as good as
                  born and knowing quite well what hardships she must endure to recover the twelve
                  brothers so carelessly mislaid by the queen. But at that we never compassed the
                  royal christening, for, all at once, there was a scraping of feet on the doorstep
                  and the next instant in flies Stina, beaming her toothless smile, a mysterious
                  bundle under her arm, and the small son tagging behind.</p>
               <p>‘God bless us, what dirty weather!’ says she, shaking the rain from
                  her ancient ulster. ‘Valdi, did you wipe your feet, my lambkin? Well, well, off
                  with your cap then and speak like a Christian.’</p>
               <p>‘My dear Stina,’ said mamma, in a queer weakish voice, ‘what on
                  earth brought you all this way in such biting rain?’</p>
               <p>‘What indeed!’ exclaimed Stina with a giggle. ‘Well, then can you
                  believe it, I got such an itch for a bit of a walk the divil himself couldn’t have
                  kept me from coming. What’s more, thought I to myself, Stina you’re a queer one if
                  now and then you can’t return a little cheer to them that always treated you to
                  victuals with an open heart. So my dear, if you’ll be taking it kindly, I’ve
                  brought a loaf of bread fresh from the oven and coffee enough to drown a
                  tomcat!’</p>
               <p>For a terrible moment I thought mamma was going to cry, her face
                  turned so white, and crinkled so queerly about the lips and eyes as she swept
                  Stina into her arms, kissing her on each wind-beaten cheek. Instead, she said
                  softly, almost gaily: ‘Dear good Stina! I should have known when God gives us
                  friends He foresees all our needs. Lara, put on the kettle and get out the best
                  tablecloth.’</p>
               <p>Well, there you are. What did we care about the lost princes after
                  that? The kitchen hummed with merriment, the old stove crackled, and the kettle
                  sang. The cat came out from his favourite corner and arched himself round Stina’s
                  leg as much as to say, Madam, even I worship before you. Out came mamma’s finest
                  porcelain cups, with the purple pansies and dabs of gold on the rim; and of course
                  the huge newly baked loaf was displayed in all its glory on the very best cake
                  plate. The coffee was good and strong and set our pulses singing with warmth and
                  happiness, although Stina insisted on a thousand apologies for the brand.</p>
               <p>‘Arbuckle’s coffee isn’t the best,’ said she, giggling. ‘But for
                  eighteen cents you can’t expect a miracle—especially when you get a coupon thrown
                  in for nothing. My Sam is saving up for a newfangled razor, and Valdi there wants
                  to get a watch, the little sparrow. So you see, the more we drink the richer we
                  get, and that’s the holy truth, my dear!’</p>
               <p>Oh, we were very gay indeed, but when Stina had departed in the
                  drizzly dusk mamma stood at the window, watching the thin figure till it faded
                  from sight. When only the thickening rain and the crowding shadows were to be seen
                  in the desolate street, she crossed to the stove where the dishpan was heating.
                  ‘Now you see how foolish it is to listen to the grumblings of the stomach,’ she
                  said, smiling at me through a mist of shining tears. ‘Put the rest of that blessed
                  loaf away. It will do us till papa’s money comes.’</p>
               <p>Sure enough it did! We had scarcely finished the last sweet crumbs
                  when the postman’s whistle announced the safe arrival of the delayed letter with
                  its sorely needed stipend.</p>
               <p>‘What did I tell you!’ laughed mamma, a little shakily. ‘Gracious
                  me! An extra dollar! And papa thinks he may be coming in a week or two. That calls
                  for a real celebration. What do you say to liver and onions for supper?’</p>

               <head>The Scene Brightens</head>
               <p>The leanest of the lean days was over; the larder was never quite
                  empty again; and, after papa rejoined the family, life quickly settled into the
                  old familiar grooves. As our aunt had prophesied, he had no difficulty getting a
                  job at better pay and shorter hours than he could ever have hoped to enjoy at ‘The
                  Saddlery’. Mamma immediately began to set aside quarters and dimes, her heart
                  fixed upon a stove that would really draw and not make such a mess of every batch
                  of bread. Well, that was very fine, said papa, but why stop at the stove? Why not
                  dream of a house in which to put it. A house with a garden and a chicken run, and
                  a barn big enough for a cow and her calf?</p>
               <p>These dreams were not much comfort to me, however. I had my own
                  troubles to solve, and no time for such nonsense. I had started school with fear
                  and trembling. How I lived through that first awful day I don’t know. The
                  principal looked at me helplessly. What was she to do with such a big child who
                  scarcely understood a word? Heaven bless her, she understood what an ox I should
                  feel among the babies—yet what was to be done? To the first grade I had to go,
                  where a very young teacher received me with the kindest smile. However, I only
                  stayed there for a day and was shunted off to the shoulders of another harried
                  lady, who took me in hand with a firm, efficient grip. Whatever the cost to both
                  of us, I must learn to read. To that end I stayed after four, and consequently
                  dashed home on wings, full of vanity and wisdom. I had actually spelled out two
                  magnificent words! Saucer! Altogether! They were honey on my lips, beautiful
                  beyond every other sound. But, alas, when my practical mamma inquired into their
                  splendid meaning, I was lost. Worse than lost when, days later, I discovered that
                  saucer had no poetic connotation whatsoever, and was just the dish from which my
                  pussie drank!</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, I bore up under the disillusionment, I was so busy
                  memorizing a host of other words, fixing their sound in my mind and translating
                  them back to their Icelandic equivalent. That was not so bad, but how on earth was
                  I to add the trick of spelling to this twofold exercise, when the sound had no
                  bearing on the letters? Why was c sometimes hard and sometimes
                  soft? And why, for goodness’ sake, was fox spelled with an f
                  and ‘phrase’ tortured with a harnessed ph? But, at that, the
                  idiom was ten times more confusing. A hound was fast when he
                  cornered the rabbit, and likewise fast when secured by a chain.
                  You were cold when the winter winds buffeted your bones, and
                  you had a cold when your flesh was burning with fever!</p>
               <p>It was all very queer, and frightfully unreasonable, but there were
                  combinations of sounds that from the first were music to my ears. I made up my
                  mind that this language was my own—that I would struggle with its capricious parts
                  as patiently as papa wooed his Icelandic phrases.</p>
               <p>I should have had a miserable time of it, however, those first few
                  months, if I had not been adopted, so to speak, by Katie Pepolenski. Katie was a
                  big Polish girl who had all the qualities which I lacked. She was pugnacious,
                  cheerful, and completely satisfied with herself, although she was poor and almost
                  an outcast in the school. We were two curiosities; two awkward foreign creatures
                  who made an easy target for the cruel humour of our small companions. Katie was a
                  dirty Pollack, and I a dirty Icelander! I, of course, was even more derided,
                  because no other child in the entire school suffered from such a peculiar
                  nationality. An Icelander! Ho, ho, look kids, she’s an Icelander! What do you
                  mean, Icelander? Eskimo, that’s what! Hey, blubber, how do you like living in a
                  wooden house?</p>
               <p>So it went, and although I could understand well enough what was
                  shouted at me, I had neither the courage nor the facility to defend myself. After
                  one such attack, when I stood cowardly and affrighted amidst a savage little mob,
                  Katie, hitting right and left with her hard brown fists, plunged through the
                  crowd, and, tucking her arm through mine, out-shouted our tormentors. ‘Leave her
                  alone, you devils! You skunks! you dirty Swedes!’ she shrilled, her dark face
                  blazing with rage. And, to my unholy delight and utter amazement, she completed
                  the rout by shrieking a blood-curdling curse: ‘You filthy Cossacks, I’ll spit in
                  your eye! I’ll spit in your eye and curse you to hell!’</p>
               <p>‘The skunks!’ sniffed Katie, as the humorists dispersed, each after
                  his own fashion, hooting, laughing, tongues pointing scorn. ‘You don’t know much,
                  do you?’ She beamed upon me. ‘Well, come along. After this, you stick by me—Katie
                  Pepolenski don’t get walked on by no dirty Americans!’</p>
               <p>Thus the queerest friendship began. Katie, it transpired, lived in
                  a tiny two-room cottage half-way up the hill that began its ascent a block or two
                  beyond our house. Her parents were Polish peasants who had come to America with an
                  eye to making a fortune, on which they hoped to retire in the beloved homeland.
                  They were doing very well, said practical Katie. Most of papa’s wages went into
                  the sock, for, by now, they owned the house, a cow, some chickens and geese. They
                  sold eggs and milk, and raised their own vegetables. With the eggs and milk money
                  Mamma Pepolenski bought flour and sugar and tea, papa’s daily pork chop, and
                  molasses cookies. This latter was almost a sacred rite, as I soon discovered.
                  Every evening after four Katie dashed to the corner market for the chop, and,
                  faster still, made her way to the little Scandinavian bakery for five cents’ worth
                  of the fat, newly iced molasses cookies. On the few occasions when the bakery had
                  not the required six cookies left Katie turned pale. Why, she always came for them
                  every day, to get them fresh! Why didn’t the bakery missus remember and keep them?
                  The bakery missus generally did, but sometimes in the busy season the extra help
                  forgot about the Pepolenski cookies. ‘Holy Mary! What will papa say? Mother of
                  God, what to do!’</p>
               <p>Katie’s big freckled face turned helpless eyes on the equally
                  helpless Icelander. ‘Maybe a white cookie will be nice for a change?’ I once
                  ventured recklessly.</p>
               <p>‘A white cookie!’ Katie shrieked. ‘A white cookie my father would
                  spit on! I should spend money on a piece of white dough? You’re crazy!’</p>
               <p>‘How about a ginger square?’ suggested the amused saleswoman.</p>
               <p>‘Six for five cents?’ haggled Katie.</p>
               <p>‘Well, no, they come a little higher, but I’ll let you have six
                  this time.’</p>
               <p>‘How much higher?’ Katie demanded, the born barterer’s gleam
                  lighting her eye.</p>
               <p>‘Four for a nickel.’</p>
               <p>Katie peered into the glass case to make sure of the size of the
                  squares and if they were frosted. Satisfied that no better substitute could be
                  found for the customary favourites, she paid over the nickel, and, with a sharp
                  request that to-morrow’s purchase be safeguarded, departed. ‘Anyway, papa won’t be
                  so mad when he knows he’s eating on the bakery,’ she informed me. ‘The frosting is
                  just as thick too. It saves on the sugar when you dunk the cookies in the
                  tea.’</p>
               <p>My first visit to the Pepolenski domicile was an absorbing
                  adventure. I had never crossed a foreign doorstep. For that was the secret source
                  of our strange attachment: each of us thought the other a queer ‘outlander’,
                  although we stood together against our common enemies. The first thing that struck
                  me when I entered the dim cool house was a peculiar smell—an unfamiliar odour that
                  permeated the whole place. Yet everything was clean as a new broom, every pot and
                  skillet scrubbed and scoured. To be sure, the small kitchen was cluttered—but
                  neatly cluttered—with all manner of strange things to see. Strings of garlic and
                  other seasoners hung from a frame above the stove; huge bags of sunflower seeds
                  adorned the wall, and, in one corner, stood a big barrel of sauerkraut. The smells
                  began to explain themselves.</p>
               <p>Katie’s mamma was a short, corpulent person, whom I never saw
                  uncovered. Her head was always adorned with a kerchief from which her round,
                  smiling face and dark, twinkling eyes peered out with candid good humour. She
                  seemed always to be on the verge of bursting into chuckles. My advent was
                  something of an occasion which called for a gift of sunflower seeds. ‘Eat! Eat!’
                  urged Mamma Pepolenski, nodding and twinkling. ‘Much good, you see!’</p>
               <p>Truth to tell, I was sadly deficient in the etiquette of
                  seed-munching, and, besides, found the delicacy rather tasteless. But Katie saved
                  my face by hustling me off to the front room. I must see their Ikon. It was from
                  Poland and occupied a place of honour above a little shelf that was dressed with a
                  crocheted fringe. Two tall candles in brass holders stood on either side and a
                  bowl of paper flowers, blue and red, made a patch of gay colour in the centre.
                  There were several lithograph prints of various saints upon the wall, and an
                  especially dolorous representation of the Saviour crowned with thorns hung above
                  the paternal bed. Except for this huge bed, and another smaller one at the back of
                  the room, the only other pieces of furniture were some wooden chests and a big
                  iron-rimmed barrel. The beds were like small mountains, so high they were with
                  feather ticks and enormous pillows, all white as snow. Katie was immensely proud
                  of the beds, on which not a wrinkle nor a ridge could be found. Their smoothness
                  depended upon expert rolling with a broom handle after the feather beds had been
                  shaken and fluffed into those proud, airy formations. ‘It’s a big job,’ said she,
                  patting a bolster with a loving, rough paw. ‘But, you should know, to be careless
                  with beds won’t get you a good husband.’</p>
               <p>The barrel inspired curiosity. It was the biggest barrel I had ever
                  seen, and why it should stand there instead of in the kitchen proved too much for
                  my limited culture. ‘Katie, why do you keep the water in here?’ I queried. ‘Isn’t
                  that awful unhandy for your mamma?’</p>
               <p>‘You’re crazy!’ said Katie, amiably. ‘That’s not mamma’s water.
                  That’s papa’s bath—don’t you wash in your house?’</p>
               <p>‘Well, not in a barrel,’ I admitted humbly. ‘How do you mean, it’s
                  your papa’s bath?’</p>
               <p>‘Holy Mary! Don’t you know anything? Oh, well, I suppose in Iceland
                  it’s too cold for a skin bath. It’s like this: every morning papa jumps into the
                  barrel, and then runs to the gate and back to get the air on his skin.’</p>
               <p>‘Katie! Not in the winter time? Through the snow—with nothing
                  on?’</p>
               <p>‘Of course. For the health, there’s nothing better,’ Katie
                  explained, smilingly patient with my ignorance. In all his life Papa Pepolenski
                  had never known a day’s illness, which blessing, thanks to God’s mercy, was due to
                  the invigorating influence of cold water on the back, and snow on the feet. Yes,
                  in winter Papa Pepolenski was even healthier than in summer, for, as every one
                  ought to know, the sun sucked the health from the body through the sweating
                  pores.</p>
               <p>Here, surely, was something to think about. Perhaps all that ailed
                  us was the lack of a water-barrel. ‘Do you jump into the water too? You and your
                  mamma?’</p>
               <p>Katie threw me a pitying glance, her face reddening with shame.
                  ‘Holy Mary, it’s good mamma can’t understand much English. Should a woman run out
                  naked—in this country? You’re crazy! It’s better not to say
                  such things. Look here, are you a Christian? I’d like to show you my confirmation
                  veil. At Easter I take my first communion.’</p>
               <p>‘I’m not a Catholic, Katie, but I’m going to be confirmed one
                  day—my sister had a veil too, and lilies of the valley for her hair.’</p>
               <p>‘Come along then!’ Katie pulled me towards one of the chests. ‘I
                  guess you’re not the bad kind of Protestant.’</p>
               <p>Mamma Pepolenski, who had been hovering in the doorway for some
                  time, now hurried forward, and shoving her daughter aside with a cautioning
                  rebuke, herself displayed the filmy treasure. Proudly she pointed out that the
                  veil reached to the heels—it would do for Katie’s wedding if the good God gave her
                  a husband. It was a beautiful veil, bought with fifty quarts of raspberries! Fifty
                  quarts picked in the early dawn, and sold in the broiling sun from door to door.
                  That was the price of Katie’s finery. ‘And may the holy saints mark the sacrifice,
                  that something comes of it!’ said Katie’s mamma, crossing herself.</p>
               <p>All these things were marvellous to me, and were passed on to my
                  own mamma with proper emphasis, but neither the sunflower seeds nor the
                  health-giving barrel impressed that stiff-necked daughter of the Viking. In fact,
                  my parent abjured me, on my oath as a civilized creature, to forgo the bird seed
                  and think no more of the water-barrel. That sort of thing was well enough for
                  Russian peasants, said she, but who ever heard of white people scampering about in
                  their skins? It was disgraceful. ‘If you can’t find better friends, do without
                  them,’ was her heartless injunction.</p>
               <p>‘But, mamma they aren’t Russians,’ I pleaded. ‘Poles are a
                  different kind of people, aren’t they, papa?’ I appealed to my milder
                  forebear.</p>
               <p>‘What do I care for all that?’ mamma interrupted crossly. ‘This
                  Katie the child runs around with is a little savage. She shouts and stalks along
                  the street like an Indian. Do you want your daughter to behave like that? Is it a
                  mark of distinction to hop into a barrel and dash out into the snow, naked as the
                  Lord made you?’</p>
               <p>‘Well, well, well, the Lord’s handiwork is not to be sneezed at, my
                  love!’ papa rejoined gravely, that glimmer of familiar mischief darkling his eye.
                  ‘I’m neither for nor against such exhilaration, but I hardly think the child will
                  come to grief because Katie’s papa disports himself so bravely.’ Then, to me:
                  ‘What does Katie talk about, my dear, besides her father’s health and the blessed
                  saints?’</p>
               <p>Now I was cornered. Instinctively, I knew that mamma would frown
                  upon our conversation about good husbands for whom one prepared by making soft
                  beds. Nor would she relish the verbal battles so colourfully peppered with pointed
                  curses.</p>
               <p>‘Oh, we talk about Poland,’ I temporized, trying to remember
                  something scholarly and impressive. ‘It’s a nice country. They have so many
                  holidays, when they dance in the street——’</p>
               <p>‘And knife each other, I’ll be bound,’ mamma interpolated, crossly.
                  ‘Put your mind on your reader and forget such foolishness. That’s my advice. And
                  don’t let me catch you shouting like a stable wench!’</p>
               <p>Mamma could be very unreasonable, I thought to myself, and stole
                  away to the window, hoping to cheer myself with a glimpse of the beautiful young
                  man who lived on the next corner.</p>
               <p>I was quite in love with him, and after Katie’s remark about a
                  husband my heart jumped like a startled mouse each time he passed. Of course, I
                  knew to the exact minute when this glorious experience might be expected. He
                  always fetched water from the pump at seven o’clock. That he was married, and
                  lived in the same sort of barn we ourselves did, nowise dampened my ardour. He was
                  tall and dark, and always wore a bright red sweater that seemed to me as beautiful
                  as a breastplate of beaten gold. Above that blazing garment his bold black head
                  rose with the proud lift of a warrior. Nor was it difficult to provide my hero
                  with a mettlesome steed and a broad axe in place of the pail. Those daily
                  excursions to the pump, told to the beat of my racing heart, were really the
                  sublimest conquests, executed with romantic dash and daring. Imaginary enemies
                  strewed the streets behind my darling as he whizzed back from the diabolic
                  stronghold of the pump with his pail, converted into a casket of glittering
                  jewels.</p>
               <p>This rendezvous at the window was the most precious moment of the
                  whole day, for which I waited with delicious twitters and bated breath. Each day
                  the glorious creature drew a deeper sigh from my suffering breast as he swung past
                  in his scarlet breastplate, cheerfully unaware of the sore havoc he was causing.
                  But, just as I was at the point of confessing my hopeless devotion to Katie, I was
                  happily cured. Alas, what should I see, one dreary November day, but my Beautiful
                  Knight trundling a baby carriage! Now, that was too much. A wife was no obstacle,
                  but a baby was definitely not in keeping with prancing steeds and heroic conquest.
                  The wretch had deceived me! Never again was my nose pressed against the
                  window-pane, nor my eye beguiled by the flash of a red sweater.</p>
               <p>It was a sad disillusionment, almost as depressing as the weather,
                  with its squalls and sleet and scudding, angry clouds. The eternal damp chill
                  seemed to leap at my throat, choking my breath with clammy fingers that left me
                  gasping and sputtering, to my utmost humiliation. Sometimes these attacks were so
                  severe that I had to sit down in the street, with Katie keeping watch between me
                  and any possible enemy. For this trusty guardianship, I was deeply grateful, yet
                  it had its bitter alloy. Katie delighted, with all her rugged soul, in defending
                  such a miserable weakling, but at times she lost patience, and banged me on the
                  back with peasant thoroughness. ‘Stop! Stop! You’ll bust yourself! Holy Mary,
                  you’re blue in the face! Here, get on with you. Hang on to my arm. Do you want to
                  catch your death in the gutter?’</p>
               <p>Under the full steam of this righteous indignation we would stagger
                  down the hill, Katie outshouting the lustiest wind as she laid down the law for my
                  benefit. If I wasn’t so crazy, I’d burn a candle to the saints. No telling but
                  they’d hear me, though I was a Protestant. Catholic saints weren’t limited in
                  their miracles. Any way, I could eat raw meat and lots of suet.</p>
               <p>‘Katie! I couldn’t—not suet!’</p>
               <p>‘Shut up—you’ll choke again,’ Katie admonished. ‘You could eat a
                  dog if you had to. Haven’t you any sense? Do you want to bark yourself to skin and
                  bones? What sort of husband would that get you, do you suppose?’</p>
               <p>No, I had no fancy to become the sort of thing Katie painted with
                  vivid word strokes and considerable relish. Katie’s mamma had known such
                  unfortunate baggages back home: pale wretches who shivered in their greyish hides;
                  hacked and wheezed their lungs away, and, finally, to no one’s regret, ended up in
                  a pauper’s grave. That last called for serious cogitation. Goodness knows, I was
                  inured to the thought of an early, saintly demise, but this pauper angle gave an
                  entirely new and sinister twist to the familiar story. I solemnly swore to Katie
                  that henceforth my prayers would be addressed to the whole calendar of saints—for
                  it seemed highly probable that if I picked one haphazard, the rest might take
                  offence—and my sole petition, for release from the wheezes and the threatening
                  shadow of a pauper’s grave.</p>
               <p>Katie thought it a capital idea, and called the Blessed Mother of
                  God to witness that she would put a copper in the poor-box on Sunday, and add her
                  sanctified prayer to mine.</p>

               <head>Fresh Misfortune</head>
               <p>Strange to say, all this piety and fervour bore sad fruit. Instead
                  of getting better, the misery increased, augmented by headaches that, after days
                  of angry raging, left my head stiff as a board, and all my senses dulled. About
                  these headaches I said no word. I had a dreadful fear of being taken out of
                  school, where, if I met with much teasing, I also derived the greatest joy. I had
                  jumped to the third standard, and was assured by the optimistic teacher that I
                  should pass into the fourth at Christmas. That would place me among children of my
                  own age, which, at the moment, represented the seventh heaven.</p>
               <p>But, as I was to find out in the years ahead, even such a simple
                  dream was not to be realized without obstacles. I went to bed one night feeling
                  oddly limp and dizzy. The bed rocked under me, and the ceiling wavered and wheeled
                  like a rift of clouds. There was a queer, sickening pressure in my chest which,
                  when I drifted towards sleep, had a terrifying effect. It was as though some
                  deeper wisdom inside me were warning me not to lose the reins of consciousness.
                  But at last I dozed off, comforted by the sound of mamma’s even breathing,
                  enheartened that her big bed was no farther away than the opposite wall.</p>
               <p>No words can describe the hideous sensation that shook me awake,
                  sending me bolt upright with a strangled cry on my lips and a gush of something
                  hot and crimson spraying my cotton nightdress. My impulse was to reach that other
                  bed, but when I tried to move, the world went black. But not before I had seen
                  mamma, who must have jumped at my scream, peering at me in the white moonlight
                  with helpless fright in her eyes.</p>
               <p>Poor mamma! For an otherwise intelligent woman, she was always
                  sorely at sea where illness was concerned. She seemed as incapable of the simplest
                  elements of nursing as father was of acquiring business sense. Her lexicon of
                  healing consisted of stuffing you with food, rubbing you with goose-grease and
                  turpentine, and rolling you in a hot blanket; where, the longer you smothered the
                  better she loved you, and the more certain she felt of eventual recovery. Freely
                  she showered her tenderness, had absolutely no fear of contagious diseases; but,
                  young though I was at this time, I had long ago discovered that the sight of blood
                  threw mamma into utter confusion. So now, fighting the most frightening giddiness,
                  I struggled to slip off my gown—no doubt I was dying, but at least mamma need not
                  touch that dreadful garment.</p>
               <p>Somehow, the night passed, and a bright day dawned, clear and cold,
                  and no sign of the golden chariot. I must have slept, for my first thought was
                  that I must have had a nightmare. I was alone in the room, with the usual
                  comforting sounds coming from the kitchen. Cautiously I slipped to the floor, and
                  found, to my vast surprise, that except for a funny sort of hollow feeling in my
                  stomach, I seemed no worse for the trying experience. Then a new fright laid hold
                  of me. I suddenly remembered Jorun Halson, and her disorganized insides. I
                  recalled, with rising agitation, all the muttered whisperings about that poor
                  creature who was less than a woman and only half a wife.</p>
               <p>My hateful doom was fixed! I studied my little carcass with
                  apprehensive eyes, trying to find some outward sign of the topsy-turvyness within.
                  So far as I could discern, my small flat chest and little white stomach exhibited
                  no visible marks of villainous treachery. To all intents and purposes, I seemed to
                  be intact; a bit wobbly in the knees, to be sure, and singularly inept with my
                  benumbed fingers as I drew on my clothes, but otherwise unchanged. That was
                  comfort of sorts, and yet I could not escape that room fast enough. I longed, as
                  never before, for the warmth of the kitchen, the reassuring hum of the old copper
                  kettle, and the welcoming purr of my precious cat. Mamma glanced up, startled,
                  when I came stealing into the kitchen and slid my chair by the table.</p>
               <p>‘Are you better? Perhaps you shouldn’t have got up,’ said she,
                  eyeing me anxiously, yet speaking harshly. As though, for once, she were weary to
                  death of my ailing capers. Dear me, I had not expected any such reception!
                  Cod-liver oil, and another cat skin, perhaps, but not an implied rebuke. Something
                  cantankerous had come over mamma as well as myself—one of the evil visitations of
                  which both Mrs. Halson and Stina spoke with such deep conviction. It often
                  happened, said they in old families which had a host of sins to their credit.</p>
               <p>Yes indeed, cases of sudden madness sometimes broke out in the best
                  of families; fits befell the sturdiest fellows, and pious mortals, who hitherto
                  had lived by faith, and crossed themselves before and after meat, were, all of a
                  twinkling, plunged into riotous iniquity. Cattle sickened; ewes forsook their
                  lambs; the hay whizzed away on a withering blast, and ravens, by twos and threes,
                  appeared upon the roof-tree, croaking doom and damnation. All this, you
                  understand, through the retributive machinations of some drear afturganga who could not rest in holy bliss till judgement day because
                  the evil wrought against it was still unrighted.</p>
               <p>That there were more than enough sinners between me and Father Adam
                  I was fully aware: not just the simple, ragtag transgressors whose sins were
                  meanness of mind and mustiness of soul, but lusty brutes, who had cracked skulls
                  as lightly as eggshells, and thought no more of stealing a pretty wench than of
                  turning a nithing-verse against their enemies. Sadder still, there had been women
                  with hearts no softer than flint, whose hands had more often caressed an avenging
                  blade than a baby’s poll. If Stina were half-way right, there must be a sizable
                  company of moping spooks to pinch and pester me and mine for the sins of our
                  fathers.</p>
               <p>Quite possibly, I should not have hit upon this plausible
                  explanation of the curse which had pounced upon me in the dead of night if now, in
                  broad daylight, I had not been confronted with such strange behaviour in my
                  parent. Astonishment and the sting of the hurt quickened my perceptions.</p>
               <p>For the first time, I saw my mother, not just as my mother, but as
                  a stout little woman with a pale mask of face behind which thoughts and emotions
                  in which I had no part moved with vexed urgency. Standing there, stirring the
                  porridge, a troubled frown knotting her brow, she seemed just as alien and much
                  more remote than Katie’s moon-faced mamma. In one of those lightning flashes that
                  illuminate the darkness of the fumbling mind, I suddenly realized what made her so
                  difficult, engaged in all her vital energies, and made me and everything else a
                  troublesome hindrance. Mamma was going to have another baby again!</p>
               <p>Heretofore, I had never thought about it. Some one was always
                  having a baby, or burying a baby. It was a commonplace nuisance, that meant a row
                  of bottles to be scalded, and diapers blowing on the line. It meant a smelly lamp
                  in the bedroom kept burning all night in case the baby needed changing—it meant a
                  hack at the door, and another small cross in the lone green field under the stars.
                  But now, for some inexplicable reason, it meant a cleavage between me and mamma.
                  It set up a kind of quivering horror in my whole being to have suddenly plumbed
                  the alarming possibilities of the female body; to have forced upon me, unsought,
                  the staggering knowledge that all the while that mamma sat quietly knitting and
                  spinning a tale from The Thousand and One Nights for our cheer
                  and amusement, her woman’s body, like a creature apart, was pursuing its own
                  creative mysteries.</p>
               <p>But the thought terrified me much more than the threat of a legion
                  of ghosts. Had I dared, had my legs not been like water, I should have run back to
                  the chilly solitude of the bedroom, which, only a few months ago I had mistakenly
                  believed was the only haunt of malicious magic. I buried my face in the cat’s
                  furry warmth, tearfully conscious of my own little miseries: that I had a horrid
                  pain in my breast, a dull aching in my head, and was practically orphaned
                  besides.</p>
               <p>‘Put the cat down,’ said my stranger mother curtly. ‘I sometimes
                  wonder if you don’t get sick messing with those everlasting animals. No telling
                  where they prowl. I declare, I’m at my wit’s end. You’ll have to see a doctor. If
                  you think you can manage it, you’d better go at once to your Aunt Haldora. She
                  will know where to take you. She knows everything—or so your father believes.
                  You’d better eat something first. Would you like a boiled egg?’</p>
               <p>Holy Mary! The exclamation dear to Katie flew into my mind, but,
                  happily for me, stayed there. An egg! Of all the foods that soured and sickened my
                  stomach, eggs were the worst.</p>
               <p>‘No thank you—I’m not very hungry,’ I whispered.</p>
               <p>‘That’s another thing! You won’t eat. Even as a baby, you set
                  yourself against milk and eggs. How do you expect to build up strength that
                  way?’</p>
               <p>I said nothing. Somehow, it no longer seemed important to attempt
                  to defend myself; to explain, to no purpose, how violently, and sometimes
                  successfully, my perverse little stomach dealt with those sainted foods. I really
                  scarcely listened to what mamma was saying, for I had unconsciously withdrawn into
                  myself to escape hearing the numbered list of ailments, past and present, which I
                  was supposed to trot out for the doctor’s benefit, so that he would know how to
                  deal with me. I tried to eat, but the bread stuck in my throat, and just to look
                  at the porridge swimming in milk was nauseating. The best I could do was to dig up
                  a spoonful or two under the white sea, and gulp down two cups of coffee.</p>
               <p>Yet, I would gladly have devoured a dozen breakfasts to put off the
                  business of starting on an errand that scared me to death. There was nothing to be
                  gained by dawdling, however. Nor the slightest use in telling mamma I was such a
                  coward. As quickly as I could, I put on my things and left the house. The air,
                  cold and sharp, and for once blessedly dry, cleared my head a little, but my feet
                  and legs needed a deal of encouraging. There was a queer, nagging pain under my
                  left breast that increased as I plodded on. Sometimes it caught me unawares,
                  piercing so sharply that I had to stop, frightened because the street, with its
                  familiar lamp-posts and heaps of dirty snow, grew indistinct and wavery, like
                  water stirred with a stick. I was almost glad for these pauses, which furnished an
                  excuse for loitering, holding back the difficult moment when I must show myself in
                  this fresh humiliation to my majestic relative. For, to tell the truth, it was the
                  thought of the coming interview, not the giddy weakness, that tormented me. My
                  aunt had not thought very highly of me heretofore; how much more despicable I must
                  now appear, coming with this fresh tale of peculiar iniquity. Moreover, it struck
                  me as a sort of spiritual insult to both of us that I should have to inflict such
                  an intimate confidence upon her. Why on earth should she be burdened with further
                  details of my weakness? Why must I be driven to bare my shame to the one person
                  whose good opinion I secretly desired above all others? For the first time in my
                  life, I thought of mamma with angry bitterness, and a little seed of doubt and
                  incipient enmity was sown in my heart. Then and there I resolved that, whatever
                  further ills should come upon me, I would keep them to myself—yes, and not only
                  disappointments, but my innermost thoughts, should be hidden, for I was beginning
                  to realize that even a mother could be astonishingly blind to the emotional temper
                  of her child.</p>
               <p>But I need not have fretted so foolishly over my aunt’s reception.
                  When I ashamedly crept into her comfortable, quiet house, she looked up sharply
                  from the book she was reading. ‘My dear child!’ she cried rising with amazing
                  spring for one so heavy, and, before I could say a word, had me stowed in a chair
                  by the glowing heater.</p>
               <p>Gently, her hand stole over my forehead, my cheek, felt my pulse.
                  ‘Now, sit where you are—sit perfectly still,’ she commanded, and sailed off to the
                  kitchen for a glass of water, into which she put some spirits from her medicine
                  closet. When I had gulped it down, holding the glass with both hands to keep it
                  from shaking, her patience cracked a little.</p>
               <p>‘What on earth are you doing out, in your condition? Don’t you know
                  you’re sick? Doesn’t your mother know it?’</p>
               <p>Miserable to extinction, I nodded. ‘Mamma sent me. She
                  thought—maybe you would take me to—to the doctor.’</p>
               <p>‘Sometimes your mother——’ she began crossly, then checked herself.
                  ‘Well, well, it’s not your fault. But no one with a grain of sense would send a
                  child in such a mess into the street by itself! It’s stupid! It’s heartless!
                  There, there, child, I’m not scolding. I’ll say no more. Now, tell aunty all about
                  it.’</p>
               <p>Well, that was not so easy. The tongue clove to the roof of my
                  mouth, and, where before I had been chilled to the marrow, I was suddenly bathed
                  in scalding perspiration. No confession ever came more hardly, or cost more pangs
                  of cutting shame. But at last it was done. After which, it was almost joy to sit
                  huddled in my faded blanket coat, letting the peace of the quiet house pour over
                  me in comforting vibrations, while aunt gave orders to the cook, and then hustled
                  into her wraps.</p>
               <p>We were not obliged to wait in the doctor’s outer office, for my
                  aunt had telephoned that she was pressed for time, and must ask an immediate
                  interview. Consequently, we sailed through the waiting-room without so much as a
                  glance at the other patients, my formidable relative a mountain of strength, with
                  me clinging to her might like a fluttering sparrow, fearful of everything and
                  everybody.</p>
               <p>Fortunately for my shrinking spirit, Dr. Keys was a soft-spoken,
                  stoop-shouldered man, with a kind, greyish face, and grave, quiet eyes. Just to
                  meet those eyes had the instant effect of easing my twitching nerves, and,
                  somehow, simplified the business of slipping out of my frock and dropping the top
                  of my petticoat. Then, too, I was spared from speech. My aunt did the talking,
                  making short enough work of the necessary explanations. In conclusion, she charged
                  the doctor:</p>
               <p>‘Give her a good going over. But don’t go putting sickly ideas into
                  her head. There’s more than enough trash under her bonnet as it is!’</p>
               <p>Dr. Keys, who knew and understood my aunt very well, chuckled, and
                  proceeded with his mysterious tappings. Obediently, I said my ‘Oh’s’ and ‘Ah’s’,
                  now loud, now whispered, and tried not to anticipate the forthcoming
                  verdict—hoping against hope that Katie’s holy saints would hide from this miracle
                  man the ultimate dark doings of my perverse insides.</p>
               <p>‘It’s the heart,’ said Dr. Keys, putting down the stethoscope, and
                  turning to my aunt. ‘Strained. Rather bad—have to be careful.’</p>
               <p>‘The heart! But doctor, that haemorrhage? The child has a terrible
                  cough,’ my aunt objected.</p>
               <p>‘Bronchial—not the real trouble.’ Dr. Keys, who apparently eschewed
                  unnecessary words, turned to his desk and began writing on a little pad. Then, as
                  in afterthought, he remarked: ‘Violent cough seldom tubercular. Complicates
                  things, though. Here you are, little lady!’ he smiled on me, holding out the bit
                  of paper. ‘Get that filled. Mind now, that you do as I say: no school till spring;
                  no running; never skip; when the queer feeling comes, stand still; count ten;
                  better still, sit down.’</p>
               <p>None of which mattered, except that injunction about school. Yet
                  such was my relief at having escaped the fate of Jorun Halson, I dared not
                  complain. No doubt at all but the saints had saved me! At the very first
                  opportunity I must tell Katie, and, if possible, slip her a penny for the Saint
                  Anthony poor-box.</p>
               <p>Buoyed up by this glorious thought, which translated my escape into
                  the nature of a miracle, I found the trip back home less difficult, although the
                  street seemed bent upon upsetting me with its mischievous wavering. Then, too, I
                  was rather proud, and vastly comforted to know that I had at last developed a
                  really ladylike ailment. It was so very fashionable to suffer with a delicate
                  heart! Mamma, much to my dismay, was not the least impressed.</p>
               <p>‘What next?’ said she. ‘What a country, where even the children get
                  weak hearts! I never heard of such a thing. Never. Well, to bed you better go.
                  I’ll bring you something to eat.’</p>
               <p>A cold reception, thought I, slinking up the stairs. Later, I
                  consoled myself with the brilliant assumption that if I were slighted too much I
                  might reasonably expect to go off in a fine burst of emotion, like the poor
                  gentleman whose wife had spurned him for a useless gallant. Such romantic fancies
                  were not of lasting compensation. The weeks dragged slowly by with monotonous
                  weariness. Something vital had gone out of the house. It had the depressing
                  atmosphere of rooms that have been stripped of the homely treasures that give them
                  living personality. No doubt what I missed were those pleasant hours when mamma
                  used to tell her dramatic yarns to the youngsters in Winnipeg. Here there were no
                  youthful contacts, no companionship of the sort that mamma deeply prized.</p>
               <p>To make matters worse, my cognizance of her condition had erected a
                  wall of inhibiting reserve between us. However hard I affected to thrust the
                  thought aside, she remained a stranger, in whom it was impossible to recapture the
                  image of the mother I had worshipped as an entity untouchable as the angels.
                  Strange though it may seem, my attachment had not been of the affections, but of
                  the mind. Mamma was my unquestioned voice of authority, my inspiration and source
                  of wisdom. I had not thought of her in terms of human weakness, nor expected from
                  her the kind of easy sympathy I had found in papa. Consequently, I was completely
                  dazed by the shocking realization that even mamma was not exempt from the
                  arbitrary fates. For the same intuition which had quickened my first understanding
                  left me in no doubt as to my mother’s own secret resentment. She had had enough of
                  babies. Yet, here she was, absorbed and utilized in the unwelcome business, and
                  daily more oppressed by the approaching event.</p>
               <p>It was all strange beyond believing, and aroused within me no end
                  of confusing speculations. I had the gloomiest forebodings that nothing would ever
                  be quite the same again; that I should never more feel certain of any preconceived
                  idea or eventuality. Having reached such a melancholy solution, I was not
                  particularly upset when I learned that Christmas would not be celebrated in our
                  house this year. Nor was I greatly astonished when even the cat disappeared. Cats,
                  I told myself mournfully, were independent souls, and not to be pressed into
                  conformity with human gloom. No doubt, wise pussy would find herself a more cheery
                  haven.</p>
               <p>On Christmas Day, Aunt Haldora made a hurried visit, bringing a
                  blast of icy air and a whirl of snow that feathered to the floor as she shook
                  herself with characteristic vigour.</p>
               <p>‘Now then, woman,’ said she addressing mamma. ‘What do you mean by
                  this dawdling? You might have finished with the business before Christmas. Yes,
                  indeed, you might have managed better. Now I suppose there’ll be no getting you to
                  help me eat the stuffed goose.’</p>
               <p>Mamma received the banter in good part. Yet, I had a distressing
                  conviction that something sharp as a sword flashed between them. That the air
                  quivered under the shock of clashing temperaments, whose differences were too
                  fixed for words. I could not have explained the why or the wherefore of this
                  sudden notion, but I knew beyond any possibility of doubt that it implied some
                  sort of ancient antagonism, some ineradicable dislike that persisted in spite of
                  their obvious respect for each other.</p>
               <p>Mamma put on the kettle for coffee as usual, and I set out the
                  china cups.</p>
               <p>‘Foolishness!’ cried my aunt. ‘I don’t need any coffee. And I’ve
                  got to rush. I’m expecting a call from my grocer’s wife any moment. Ja, that’s why
                  I came up here. I’m wondering which of you is going to interrupt my dinner. Well,
                  Lars, what do you say to joining me? If I know my dear brother, you’re not much
                  use around the house. Ingiborg will be just as well off without you.’</p>
               <p>Well, papa hemmed and hawed a little. He ought not to leave mother
                  alone, he said. There was no one to send in an emergency alarm. Brother Minty had
                  gone off for the day with a group of boys, and there was no telling when he’d be
                  home. No doubt the whole lot of them would be hanging around the harbour until
                  sunrise—they talked of nothing but ships and the sea.</p>
               <p>‘At least, that’s what I gather from Minty’s chatter,’ finished
                  papa, and took a pinch of snuff.</p>
               <p>‘Yes, and you encourage him,’ mamma spoke impatiently. ‘You never
                  say a word against all that silly talk of the sea.’</p>
               <p>‘Well, what’s the use of talking when a boy gets that kind of idea
                  in his head?’ my aunt interposed defensively. ‘You don’t imagine I wanted Finny to
                  rush off to war? But, at that, you’ve got to let the youngsters find their own
                  legs somehow. One way’s no worse than another. Well, I must be off. I’ll expect
                  you before six, Lars. As for you, my fine woman, if you’ve got any sense, go to
                  bed and get some rest.’</p>

               <head>Solitary Christmas</head>
               <p>Even with this cheerful break and the little bag of sweets aunt
                  left for me, that Christmas was a dreary experience. The chill of it entered my
                  very bones. It was so much harder to accept the betrayal of an ideal than to
                  suffer ordinary aches and pains. Even a bilious attack would have been easier to
                  bear than the creeping coldness of a house where not a single candle burned to the
                  glory of the Little Christ Child. True, papa had tried to offset the gloom by
                  putting up a huge tree in the extra bedroom, which was cold, uncurtained, and
                  empty of furnishings. After supper, which I ate alone in the kitchen, I put on my
                  best dress, and, thus girded with the trappings of gaiety, I made a bold attempt
                  to keep holiday vigil in that cheerless room. But, although I lit the brightly
                  coloured candles, and sat myself, Buddha-fashion, under the festive tree, nothing
                  remotely joyous came of it. The twinkling lights were bravely beautiful, but their
                  tiny, heart-shaped flames were no match for the unfriendly shadows that filled the
                  room. Even when I tried to sing Holy Night—under my breath, so
                  as not to be heard across the hall—the darkness only deepened. The shadows assumed
                  fantastic shapes in mocking opposition to my lame merry-making. Tearfully, I
                  snuffed the lights, and went to the window, seeking, as I loved to do, the far
                  distraction of the sky: that jewelled space, wing-spread above the small green
                  stage of earth.</p>
               <p>It was lovely night. The ugly street had put on a gentle beauty.
                  Feathery snow, drifting thickly through the windless air, thatched the houses in
                  layers of shimmering down. On the slope in the foreground three squat cottages
                  reminded me of old ladies in hoods of Iceland wool, their slits of eyes smiling
                  goldenly upon the peaceful earth. The uneven road lay smooth and white as a
                  winding sheet let down from the dark fastnesses of the hills in the
                  background.</p>
               <p>Not a soul could be seen, except the solitary dog that shot across
                  the path, sniffing the ground, the plume of his tail hugging his flank as he
                  bounded along. Poor dog! I hoped he was not lost, nor driven by cold and hunger. I
                  hoped he was on his way to a house where laughter rang, and the spicy odours of
                  Christmas filled the air. As for me, I glued my own nose to the black pane and,
                  gazing upwards through the dropping snow, found the silent, silver stars.</p>
               <p>Young and foolish though I was, I could not for long fix upon that
                  splendid spectacle and not be quieted when I remembered the timeless history in
                  their watchful keeping; when my mind opened like a window upon the past that was
                  as thick with human souls as the blue above was thick with drifting snowflakes.
                  Suddenly, I found myself thinking of the tales papa loved to tell of the great
                  law-givers of Iceland: of sages and singers, and fearless men of arms; a mighty
                  company, whose deeds lived after them to inspire courage in the desolate ages that
                  lay in store for their descendants. Those tales had often bored me—they had seemed
                  so far removed from the tiny orbit of my tiny life. Now it seemed to me that those
                  resplendent souls were drawing near, almost I could see them in the ghostly
                  Valhalla of the dreamy night; almost I could hear their voices shattering the
                  silence of centuries, bridging the illusion of time and the cold chasm of dead
                  yesterdays. A strange excitement thrilled me, for now I understood a little what
                  papa meant by the immortality of right effort. That which people accomplished,
                  whether good or evil, was the true substance of themselves, and could not perish.
                  It went on and on, born in memory and the hearts of later generations.</p>
               <p>To me, forlornly standing at that uncurtained window, it seemed a
                  profound discovery, a revelation that clothed those historic figures in lovable
                  humanity, that made them real and companionable. Why, thought I, how easily the
                  years fell away, bringing us all together in unified existence, when I stopped to
                  think that the same stars which now were my consoling inspiration had lighted
                  those stormy souls upon their stressful ways. And how much that was terrible and
                  splendid they had witnessed on even my ancestral heaths! Embittered Gudrid,
                  plotting death against Kjartin, whom she loved; Olaf’s harper, singing with the
                  arrow in his breast; dark deeds and fair, repeated over and over under these
                  selfsame stars that shone upon our shabby little house. Oh, and, most wonderful of
                  all, these same white lights had guided the longships of Leif Ericson over the
                  shoulder of the world!</p>
               <p>Tears dribbled down my cold little nose, but whether for these
                  lofty sentiments or my own returning loneliness, who can say? It is hard to
                  sustain majesty when one is only just turned eleven. Shivering, and sweetly sad, I
                  scuttled down the stairs to the front room, where, for the last few days, I had
                  been sleeping, on an exceedingly slippery sofa. I do not know when my father came
                  home, or whether my aunt returned with him. I only know that when I wakened next
                  morning she was out in the kitchen, cheerfully drinking coffee and telling papa,
                  in stentorian tones, that she hoped to heaven this was the last of his nonsense.
                  Catching sight of me, she quickly changed the subject. ‘Well, my girl,’ said she,
                  ‘you better go upstairs and see what a fine new brother you have got. But mind,
                  don’t touch him—you don’t look as though you could manage a mouse, let alone a
                  baby.’</p>
               <p>‘I don’t want to touch him,’ I said. Which was perfectly true. I
                  have always had a horror of new-born babies. Then, duty-bound to explain such a
                  strange phenomenon, I added, ‘I don’t think there’s much to see any way. They all
                  look alike.’</p>
               <p>‘Well!’ snorted my aunt. ‘Well! Well!’ And looked at me as though
                  she really saw me for the first time—but whether in a good light or not, I had no
                  way of telling.</p>

               <head>The World Enlarges</head>
               <p>The winter dragged along, with little or nothing to break the
                  monotony. An occasional visit from Stina was the highlight of endless days that
                  seemed to me just an eternal round of stupefying washings. To begin with, you
                  washed yourself, or were washed. Then your little sister was washed. Then the
                  breakfast dishes. Then the baby, the baby’s bottles, and the baby’s clothes,
                  including a million diapers to be hung in the sun, or the air, at least. The lamp
                  chimneys had to be washed and polished. Then the kitchen floor. By which time the
                  dishpan was full again, thanks to the noonday porridge, flatbread, or pancakes.
                  Well, now one might breathe a little in dryness and comfort, you would think. Oh
                  no! This was a fine time to wash out the new stockings that mamma had knitted, or
                  to turn out the cupboard, or launder papa’s shirts. After which, of course, one
                  had coffee to sustain the spirit, and provide a bit more work for idle hands.
                  Which left an interlude for taking in the diapers, to be folded corner-wise, and
                  for scorching flour for the baby’s buttocks. Well! well! now it was high time to
                  wash the potatoes for supper. Just barely time, in fact, before the baby had to be
                  washed again for the night, together with his bottles.</p>
               <p>The only exceptions to these cleansing festivals were my
                  half-hearted visits to Aunt Haldora. I had really no wish to go, because of
                  shyness and a deep sense of my inferiority. But my parents seemed to consider it a
                  sort of duty, and, doubtless to make it a sanctified gesture, the visits were
                  generally made on Sunday. This sharpened the ordeal, for aunt always insisted I
                  should join the family at dinner, which I consumed in thorough discomfort,
                  convinced as I was that every one present must know me for a nitwit with a
                  bobinjay heart.</p>
               <p>At this time my aunt had not as yet converted her house into the
                  cottage hospital, although the plan was formulating in her energetic mind. But,
                  being eminently practical, she had let the two best rooms on the upper floor to
                  the Baptist minister, who was considered one of the handsomest and most eligible
                  bachelors in the town. Naturally, I stood in fearful awe of this paragon, and
                  could scarcely attend to my dinner for watching his every gesture.</p>
               <p>He certainly was handsome, and quite gay, but apt to be brusque in
                  speech, and even caustic, for he was something of an intellectual, and doubtless
                  chafed a good bit under the narrow restrictions peculiar to the prevailing order
                  of piety. He had dark eyes of exceptional brilliance, that seemed to snap and
                  crackle at odd moments. Consequently, if he so much as turned in my direction, if
                  only to ask for the vinegar cruet, I shivered in my boots, and sprouted gooseflesh
                  all over my shrinking carcass. That he was an exceptional person I concluded more
                  especially from a strange little habit he followed. At the close of each meal he
                  ate a glass of bread and milk—not out of need or preference for such food, but
                  because he had established the habit as a kind of ritual, by which he honoured the
                  memory of his parents, who had been devout Quakers, and whose fare had always been
                  poor and meagre. This peculiar gesture amused many people, but to me, always eager
                  to seize upon the unusual, the strange rite seemed exceedingly poetic and
                  impressive.</p>
               <p>In time, I am sorry to say, the awesomeness of the young minister
                  somewhat faded. I had joined the Sunday school of his church, and there, much to
                  my amazement, heard him discussed with reckless familiarity. It was said that his
                  looks, not his sermons, of which many ancient worthies disapproved, filled the
                  pews; that maidens young and not so young, who tripped up the aisles arranged in
                  their Sabbath best, thirsted less for salvation than for the sight of his flashing
                  eyes. The most persistent worshippers were two spinsters, who had, of course, to
                  be tolerated, for their papa was a substantial citizen, and the younger daughter
                  played the church organ. This gave her a tremendous advantage over lesser damsels,
                  who could only teach in Sunday school, or sew aprons for the occasional
                  bazaars.</p>
               <p>That the boiling devotion of these two devout virgins was something
                  of an odious pest I came fully to realize, for not infrequently, when the
                  persistent ladies swarmed up the front steps of the house, the poor young minister
                  would flee down the back stairs, to escape by way of the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Once, grinning like a gamin, he said to the cook: ‘I’m out,
                  Lena—that is, I shall be out by the time you deliver the
                  message, so neither of us need suffer a twinge of conscience!’</p>
               <p>‘He’s the nicest young man. Too nice for the cloth!’ Lena confided
                  to me, happening to be there on some errand. ‘Puts him at the mercy of every old
                  scarecrow as pretends she has a sin to confess, or a soul to save,’ said she,
                  hotly, pulling off her checkered apron to answer the snarling doorbell. ‘Blooming
                  shame, the way those old maids chase after him.’</p>
               <p>On this occasion it was the organist, who had come to discuss the
                  Sabbath hymns with her pastor, only to find her way barred by a resolute and
                  far-seeing cook.</p>
               <p>‘No use asking you in, Miss,’ Lena’s voice soared triumphantly,
                  ‘his reverence has gone for the day. Called away sudden, he was—fearful sudden.
                  Like as not, one of them deathbed miseries. Leastwise, we ain’t expecting him back
                  for supper. I’ll tell him you called, Miss, and thank you kindly.’</p>
               <p>Returning to the kitchen, Lena beamed delightedly. ‘That’s once she
                  didn’t get her hooks into him, the minx!’ said she. ‘Now, mind, don’t be
                  misunderstanding me. I ain’t saying that I’d set myself against nature. But it
                  ain’t nature for an old girl who’s clean forgot the year of her dipping to fasten
                  herself on a young man, even if he is a minister. The poor thing ain’t all gospel!
                  He’s soft-hearted, he is. Why, when your uncle drowned that litter of kittens last
                  week, the Reverend lost his taste for dinner, he was that upset about old Puss.
                  ’Tain’t Christian, says he, to be taking the poor thing’s babies from her. That’s
                  what I call a soft heart. And more like it will be his undoing, the world being
                  what it is, all pitfall and trouble here below!’</p>
               <p>Naturally, this bit of touching information increased my admiration
                  no end, and also my concern for the handsome pastor. In fact I began to watch the
                  organist with a coldly critical eye. At first glance there was nothing formidable
                  about the lady. She was small and mousy, and wore a brown poplin skirt that hugged
                  her narrow hips and flared out below the knees, making me think of a tea-cosy
                  marching up the aisle. Above the cosy, rose a pink shirt-waist adorned with a
                  frilled neckpiece, stiffly starched, and so immaculate that, in contrast with her
                  face, the latter, piously unpowdered and sabbatically grave, had the look of a
                  discoloured mushroom.</p>
               <p>It was, at best, an inoffensive, pointed face, trained to a
                  righteous smile that never varied, except when her mild brown eyes were fixed upon
                  her shepherd in glowing worship. Which I, of course, interpreted as the outward
                  sign of a desperate mind hatching fresh and feverish plots for the poor man’s
                  undoing!</p>
               <p>Fortunately for my own peace of mind, I was soon back in school,
                  where, to my everlasting surprise, I found myself promoted to the fourth standard,
                  and so, at last, among children of my own age. The wonder of it warmed me through
                  and through. For, think of it, I was no longer the big lout among babies, but just
                  another kid in the class, with nothing to mark me out for special torment except
                  my yard-long pigtails and my peculiar nationality. And even that would only have
                  to be admitted when teacher recorded our names.</p>
               <p>When the midday bell sounded I found myself marching out of the
                  building with two other girls, bursting with protestations of friendship. In one
                  voice they offered to walk home with me. That was very nice, very gratifying, and
                  I tried to say so, but, out of the tail of my eye, I could see the dark figure of
                  Katie, hovering in the foreground, a deep frown on her stormy brow.</p>
               <p>‘I can’t—I’ve got to go with—with Katie,’ I stuttered. ‘I—I guess
                  she’s waiting.’</p>
               <p>‘But you’re not a Pollack!’ exclaimed the small wisp at my right,
                  whose face was guileless as an angel’s.</p>
               <p>‘Well, I’m just as queer,’ said I, resolved to face the music and
                  be done with it. ‘I’m an Icelander. Anyway, she’s nice—she picked a million
                  raspberries to buy a confirmation veil!’</p>
               <p>‘Gosh, that’s funny! I mean, it’s the cat’s whiskers, everybody
                  thinking everybody else is queer!’ whooped the other, a sallow girl with stringy
                  hair but the liveliest grey eyes. ‘What’s the difference anyhow? If Katie wants to
                  come along too—it’s all right, isn’t it, Tilly?’</p>
               <p>An innocent question, yet the words implied a challenge bordering
                  on a threat, so it seemed. The little wisp grinned sheepishly. ‘I don’t care. Did
                  I say she wasn’t nice? You’re always jumping at me, Laura J.!’</p>
               <p>‘Rats!’ snapped the grey-eyed one, and shot away to intercept
                  Katie, now slowly moving down the hill. Thereafter, for a period of almost a year,
                  we made a solid foursome, against which the battery of even the fiercest derision
                  was as chaff. For, if Katie was a firebrand, Laura Johnson was a comet of
                  destruction. Even in class it was risky business for the toughest boy to pull a
                  face in her direction, let alone lodge a spitball in her ash-blonde hair. A new
                  boy tried it, to his burning sorrow, one lazy afternoon, only to find a hellcat on
                  his neck, a howling fury, who not only scratched, but bore him to the floor in an
                  undignified, tangled mass.</p>
               <p>‘Laura! Laura! LAURA!’ bawled the stoutish
                  teacher who ruled our destinies. ‘What in the world!’</p>
               <p>‘The dirty rat spit in my hair!’ shouted the Amazon, letting go of
                  the scarlet culprit, and smoothing down her frock, the while she fearlessly glared
                  back at the astonished teacher.</p>
               <p>‘Dear me! Dear me! I am ashamed of you!’ cried
                  the lady, helplessly. ‘Willie, is that true? Were you blowing spitballs?’</p>
               <p>‘I said he was, didn’t I!’ Unabashed, Laura answered for him
                  angrily. ‘Do you think I’d bash him up for nothing?’</p>
               <p>Any one else guilty of such an outburst would have been soundly
                  strapped for the insolence, but, as always, there was something so engagingly
                  honest in Laura’s violent exhibition that all the punishment she received was a
                  piece of memory work after four, and the unbounded respect of the young roughneck
                  she had pummelled.</p>
               <p>Tilly Rhinertson, on the other hand, was such a mild little soul
                  that she invited criticism. Even the teacher was not above caustic remarks, and on
                  more than one occasion almost drew tears by her cruel fault-finding. Why didn’t
                  Tilly straighten up? Was she put together on a shoe string? What made her so
                  inattentive? If she hadn’t slept, why didn’t she stay in bed—school was no place
                  to slump about half asleep!</p>
               <p>Tilly shrank into herself, smiling. But, to me, who, as time
                  passed, had come to understand the why and wherefore of Tilly’s stoop and
                  tiredness, these jibes were hateful. So hateful that I grew to detest the fussy,
                  fuming instigator of them, and it inspired my first resentment against all
                  self-appointed critics of outspoken opinions.</p>
               <p>How Tilly came to attach herself to Laura was no mystery, although
                  they had so little in common, for, with all her tartness and temper, Laura Johnson
                  had a kind, generous nature. When she ranted and raved Tilly stood by, smiling, no
                  doubt unconsciously enheartened by an exercise of talent denied to herself. Not
                  that Tilly was either a coward or stupid. Far from it. But by nature she was of a
                  temperament that preferred any compromise to outright battle, and if her speeches
                  sometimes lent themselves to hurtful connotation it was because timidity, rather
                  than harsh intention, made her blurt out what happened to come into her head. In
                  time she was to shake off all these weaknesses and more than justify the affection
                  she inspired in those who really knew her.</p>
               <p>We became extremely fond of each other—formed one of those lasting,
                  unalterable friendships which are rare among womenkind. For neither distance nor
                  altered circumstances had the least effect upon our little threesome. We
                  quarrelled like cats among ourselves, but stood back-to-back against all others.
                  Yet not until death removed one of us were we really made aware of how deep and
                  true this childish alliance was, how much it had meant in affection, and how
                  impossible to replace.</p>
               <p>The Rhinertsons lived in a ramshackle house, built under the brow
                  of the hill, upon which the Halson houses stood like hungry cormorants staring
                  bleakly into unfriendly space. To the critically minded, they must have seemed a
                  shiftless lot. The house ran itself. Certainly, there was no evidence of human
                  interference. Except on Sunday, when things were ‘redded up’, and Mrs. Rhinertson
                  concocted a very good cake and a huge batch of waffles against the coming of
                  visitors, I doubt if any one ever knew where a single object, garment, or staple
                  of food was logically to be found. Ordinarily, some sort of meal was cooked,
                  somewhere near the customary hours, and was eaten by those members of the family
                  who happened to be on hand. If they were not on hand, or the meal had disappeared,
                  the unfortunate ones rustled up a bite as best they could. Even the chickens, upon
                  whose largess these delinquents usually depended, led the same, disorganized life,
                  scattering eggs where fancy dictated, and thus provided a thrilling hunt for the
                  hungry children.</p>
               <p>In this clutter the family lived with supreme good nature and
                  contentment. Exhibitions of temper were almost unheard of, as no one in the family
                  even thought of seriously criticizing any one else. Mr. Rhinertson, a tall, gaunt
                  Norwegian, years older than his wife, was a master-carpenter, an occupation which
                  at that time was both well paid and in constant demand. So far as I know, he was
                  always employed, yet the net result was only a string of children and the old
                  house, which kept sprouting additions to accommodate the growing brood. In her
                  youth Mrs. Rhinertson must have been an extremely pretty woman, of the delicate
                  blonde type, which, unfortunately, too often fades into pale insignificance. At
                  this time she was still comparatively young and slender, but reminded me of a
                  weedy willow, precariously braced upon a crumbling river bank. She looked, in
                  fact, as though the least wind could whisk her away, and that, upon the slightest
                  effort, she would fall apart. Even her clothes hung upon her in a loose,
                  disheartened manner, as if not at all certain that this was their rightful peg.
                  Her hair, of very fine texture, had lost its former sheen, and straggled in
                  cobwebs from under the knot at the base of her neck, and her voice, equally
                  colourless, was faintly quarrelsome, though not ill-natured.</p>
               <p>Yet, for all this seeming listlessness, Mrs. Rhinertson was
                  tremendously tenacious, and fulfilled her specific functions with marvellous ease.
                  Dressmaking was her love and passion, and she much preferred to run up a new frock
                  to laundering an old one. So, too, she seemed to bear new babies with less effort
                  than was involved in keeping track of her former creations. Once born, the babies
                  became Tilly’s concern, and Tilly grew stoop-shouldered, bent as a little old
                  woman, under these ever-present burdens.</p>
               <p>These and many other quirks and peccadillos peculiar to the
                  Rhinertson ménage, I was not fully to understand, however,
                  until we had moved into their neighbourhood and our association became more
                  intimate.</p>
               <p>That we did make such a move, and to that particular locality, came
                  about through a combination of circumstances that require a somewhat lengthy
                  explanation. We had no thought of moving at this time, for papa was desperately
                  bent upon saving a few dollars out of each wage-packet, towards building some sort
                  of cottage on the edge of town, and, of course, it seemed a very remote
                  possibility. Then, in rapid succession, occurred two tragic events which, in
                  aftermath, decided our course and fixed us in the hills for years to come.</p>
               <p>To begin with, John Halson’s house burned down. As aunt had
                  predicted, the fire broke out in the good man’s cluttered study, which, on the
                  instant, was transformed into a roaring furnace. The family barely escaped with
                  their lives. The children slept in a loft, which was reached by a trap door and a
                  ladder that descended into the kitchen. This way of escape was cut off by the
                  leaping flames and clouds of coiling smoke from below. Except for the energy of
                  Julie, who somehow managed to bundle the half-smothered younger children through a
                  tiny window, it is certain they must quickly have perished. As, indeed, they might
                  all have perished in their beds if Johnnie’s little terrier had not roused them
                  with his furious barking. His last loving service. How we wept to see his tiny,
                  blackened form among the ruins! How bitterly poor Julie berated herself because
                  the blinding smoke had forced her to jump before she could reach and save the
                  little creature.</p>
               <p>However, the dire needs of the destitute family quickly eclipsed
                  everything else. Not a scrap, except the night-clothes in which they fled,
                  remained to them. Of course, they found shelter in Einar’s house, but three rooms
                  could not for long shelter so many souls. My aunt was called upon, and rushed to
                  the rescue.</p>
               <p>She found a house, and paid the first month’s rent, and then, with
                  customary firmness, she approached the ladies of the Presbyterian Church, of which
                  she was an adherent, and not so much asked as demanded that every one who had a
                  stick of odd furniture, extra bedding, cooking utensils, and clothes, should do
                  her Christian duty. She made the same appeal to her grocer, and to the coal
                  company—and heaven only knows who else. Consequently, the Halsons became a sort of
                  holy crusade, for whose deliverance the whole town was shortly rallied. In less
                  than a week they were far richer in goods than ever before, and infinitely better
                  fed. Nor was that enough. Recognizing that now was their day of destiny, my aunt
                  so worked upon the emotions of the head of the business college that Emma found
                  herself enrolled without cost. Aunt, of course, furnished her with the necessary
                  books.</p>
               <p>‘So far so good,’ said she to papa, who had been doing his bit in
                  the rehabilitation scheme. ‘The poor creatures are safe for a few weeks, but you
                  know what public sympathy is. It never lasts. Something new pops up to claim
                  attention. Nor am I such a fool as to expect that virtuous windbag, John Halson,
                  to change his habits. He’ll never work where he has found such easy bread. I tell
                  you, Lars, we must ship the whole lot to the coast. It might be the making of
                  them.’</p>
               <p>‘Bless my soul!’ exclaimed papa. ‘Where will you find the money to
                  send six people to the coast?’</p>
               <p>‘Tch! Tch! Would it be cheaper to feed the whole tribe for years to
                  come? Besides, there are plenty of people in this town who can well afford to give
                  a few dollars towards helping to make something of those very decent
                  youngsters.’</p>
               <p>Which point she speedily proved, for I imagine it would have been
                  as difficult to withhold a contribution when my aunt marched in upon a simple
                  business-man as to evade a Government levy. She was not the kind of woman to whom
                  one offered excuses. The glance of her penetrating grey eyes, and the slightly
                  scornful curl of her firm mouth, was much too disquieting. Moreover, even silly
                  people recognized the absolute justice of her impersonal attitude. If she asked
                  for anything it was because the thing had to be done, and the doing of it somehow
                  acquired honour.</p>
               <p>It was not my aunt’s intention that the Halsons should be shunted
                  into unknown waters, as it were, without the best possible preparation. Papa wrote
                  to acquaintances he had made at the coast through his journalistic articles,
                  sounding these men for information as to working conditions in general and the
                  fortunes of the Icelandic immigrants in particular. A stone might have wept at his
                  description of the Halson calamity, the inference being that John was another Job,
                  supporting in holy patience the afflictions of the Almighty, confident that, in
                  due season, a righteous recompense would be meted unto him. To have any part
                  whatsoever in helping such a good man to realize the fruits of his faith must, as
                  a matter of course, be a profitable undertaking, bringing dividends of personal
                  satisfaction and wel-being. After this philosophic preamble, papa was naturally
                  inspired to interpret the glorious possibilities inherent in the Halson children,
                  every one of whom became creatures of the highest genius and unsullied character,
                  waiting the guiding hand of some good Samaritan.</p>
               <p>In the meantime Julie found a job in a restaurant, Johnnie ran
                  errands, Emma struggled with shorthand, and their saintly father, having borrowed
                  what books he could, enheartened his wife with high, unworldly thoughts as she
                  scrubbed at the washboard. For the present, the family had settled, so much as
                  might be, into the old family rut: the children bringing home the loaves and
                  fishes; mamma cheerfully performing the labours of Martha so that dearest papa
                  might be free to interpret the tortuous ways of the spirit. With this difference,
                  however, that an eager, adventurous sparkle was to be marked in the young faces as
                  the girls speculated upon the forthcoming wonders of the coast, and, as for
                  Johnnie, he had already fixed his mind upon the sea. He meant to be a sailor and
                  visit every sinful port of which he had ever read, ending up a captain of a great
                  ocean liner. All of which (to anticipate the future) shabby little Johnnie
                  accomplished, to the complete vindication of seemingly idle dreams.</p>
               <p>There were other and tragic results of the fire. Whether from the
                  shock of witnessing the terrifying spectacle, or from the exhaustion of rendering
                  help beyond her feeble strength, Jorun Halson fell ill, and took to her bed. At
                  first her general weakness and the heavy cold on her chest were not taken
                  seriously. It was by no means an uncommon experience for the frail invalid to
                  suffer these bouts with bronchitis and fever. Helga flew about with poultices,
                  delicate broths, and, by night and day, saw that there were hot flat-irons at the
                  patient’s feet. These ministrations had never failed before, but now, as the slow
                  days filed away, a depressing doubt began to torture her. Dear Jorun was not
                  making any sort of recovery. The doctor was called, but even his energetic,
                  conscientious efforts brought no improvement. The little lady whose shining spirit
                  had been such an inspiration to the two plain souls who worshipped her had reached
                  the end of her weary pilgrimage. There was nothing to be done but watch with her
                  through this last dark stretch of the journey.</p>
               <p>Papa undertook to relieve the husband and Helga in their nightly
                  vigils. It was the sort of duty for which his gentle, sympathetic nature was
                  eminently fitted. He, who had so often been perilously close to the borderland,
                  understood what sort of comfort the dying woman needed. Hour upon hour, her small,
                  cold hand in his, he sat beside her; silent when her need was peace; or telling,
                  one by one, as on a rosary the everlasting verities upon which her heart must
                  fix.</p>
               <p>To have known and recognized the permanence of beauty; to have
                  understood, however dimly, the everlasting quality of love, which motivates and
                  sustains the living universe; and to have supported sorrow with unembittered
                  patience: these three simple concepts of the true nature of life and man’s power
                  to rule his own spirit were a sufficient augury of an irrefutable immortality.
                  Whatever was good or beautiful was eternal, and to have shared in either was to
                  have projected oneself into an everlasting medium.</p>
               <p>Toward the end, Jorun’s mind, as so often happens, sharpened,
                  becoming lucid as a quiet pool which reflects with silvered radiance each glancing
                  light ray. In her little whispering voice she recounted bits of loveliness from
                  the long-lost past. How sweetly the shrike had sung on the green hills of Iceland!
                  How liquid and full of song were the rushing waterfalls—living lace let down by an
                  angel’s hand to soften the hard shoulders of the old grey promontories—how she had
                  laughed to see the small lambs frisking in the flower-strewn meadows.</p>
               <p>‘You remember our mountains, when the sun beat down on their
                  mottled flanks, picking out all the glowing colours of their Joseph’s coat? I
                  could never climb to the top like my happier friends, who had no infirmities.
                  Perhaps that is why they have remained for me, “The everlasting hills, whence
                  cometh our strength”. I could never catch a sight of the sea from their snowy
                  peaks—but I think I saw God in their quiet shadow. Oh, I thought of many
                  things—not the kind of things that my poor Helga would credit, for, you see, I
                  would like to have done something in the world—it was not easy to accept the part
                  of a useless, broken thing.’</p>
               <p>No doubt a sensible soul would have stopped this flood of
                  melancholy confidences, but papa was not a sensible soul, thank God! He had the
                  tender heart of an unsuccessful poet, whose sensibilities have not congealed into
                  sterile ink. He knew, with the wisdom of the dreamer, that drops of pain bear
                  witness to the growing life of the soul. He knew that this tragic murmur was not
                  so much a futile grief for those unrealized opportunities as it was a tender
                  pleading for assurance that what she had forged for herself out of her own inner
                  resources was imperishable and true. He let her talk, and only hoped that Helga
                  and Einar, whose comfort lay in the belief that their faithful care had brought
                  her happiness, would not waken to be wounded by useless regret. Good, practical
                  souls, it would not be given to them to understand how this unburdening would
                  release the spirit unto its own immortal joys.</p>
               <p>‘I don’t know why I tell you these things,’ she whispered on. ‘I
                  don’t even know why I should think of it now—except that it surprises me to find
                  that all of it is so clear. For, you see, I had tried so hard to bury my dead. It
                  had been so long since I resigned myself to the dullness of an existence devoid of
                  hope. Determined to hide from every one my consternation that you could go on
                  living, knowing so well that the future held no surprises—that even death, which
                  touched me so early, would neither ease my hurt nor end my secret
                  questioning.’</p>
               <p>‘Dear Jorun, why not grasp that thought more firmly. Isn’t there
                  something wonderful in the realization that, no matter how hard we try to accept
                  defeat, it comes to this: that, in the end, every smallest broken hope returns as
                  full of vital yearning as ever it was? Is not that the greatest surprise of all,
                  and reason to believe in the everlasting realm of thought? Death touched you, you
                  said. Are you then so sure it was not Life—the only true life, which is the
                  essence of all ideas—that chose you out of the stream of everyday toilers, to
                  search out its mysteries in quietness and resignation?’</p>
               <p>The dying woman’s eyes shone with unearthly brightness. ‘I do not
                  know if I rightly understand you. I am such a simple, unlettered woman, but it is
                  true that I have thought more than I might have under better circumstances. Not
                  deeply, but earnestly, and still the thread of what you might say seems
                  indistinct. Yet, how sorely I long to know!’</p>
               <p>Papa grasped her hand with gentle firmness. ‘My dear friend, what
                  is there to know beyond what you yourself have discovered? That God reveals
                  himself in every circumstance and experience. Yes, in the doubts of our hearts, no
                  less than in our highest aspirations! Wasn’t it all said, with moving simplicity,
                  by a stubborn little man who had to be stricken blind before he could see the
                  truth of anything:</p>
               <p>‘ “For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
                  principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor
                  any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God.” ’</p>
               <p>That, in essence, is the story of Jorun’s passing. That I should
                  remember it more clearly than many a personal experience is not strange. Aside
                  from the gift father had of recounting even the smallest events, so that they
                  became as real as concrete pictures, this particular incident was rendered
                  memorable by a peculiar phenomenon. I don’t know what wakened me, but wake I did
                  this night, and, sitting up suddenly, I saw that mamma was also awake, and staring
                  intently, her face white and strained in the dim light, at something I could not
                  see.</p>
               <p>‘Mamma!’ I shouted, my skin prickling queerly, for no reason.
                  ‘Mamma!’</p>
               <p>‘Be still,’ said my mother, sinking back upon her huge pillow. ‘Go
                  to sleep, child. I thought perhaps your father might be coming home.’</p>
               <p>Well, that sounded reasonable enough, yet I could not stop
                  shivering, or keep from searching the shadows with expectant eyes, and the dawn
                  was creeping in at the window before I drowsed again. We were at breakfast when
                  father came back; very grave and tired; he slipped in and hung up his coat and hat
                  without a word. Mamma set out another coffee cup.</p>
               <p>‘So she is gone,’ said she. ‘You need not tell me. She died at
                  three. I know. I saw her, God rest her sweet soul.’</p>
               <p>‘Yes, at three,’ papa answered, without surprise, and began to sip
                  his coffee. ‘It was a happy death, my dear.’ And so, the tale unfolded.</p>
               <p>That mother should have seen Jorun gliding into the room, to stand
                  for the moment, smiling, at the foot of my bed, occasioned no astonishment to
                  either parent. Mamma saw such things, and took them for granted. She always knew
                  when any one near or dear was seriously ill, and was always warned of a close
                  death. It was just as commonplace as the clouds in the sky, or the white summer
                  rain washing the street. Something so ordinary that to surround it with mystery
                  and make of it a topic of dissension would have seemed to her the height of
                  foolishness. In all her life mamma never revealed the slightest interest in any
                  phase of an after-life. If it existed, well and good, said she. If not, also well
                  and good. In either case, her speculation about it would have no appreciable
                  effect. Death was as arbitrary as birth and what followed was equally beyond human
                  control.</p>
               <p>For so-called spiritualism, and for the quibbling spiritualists
                  whose little societies were creeping up everywhere, she had an amused contempt—the
                  same sort of contempt she had for the egotist who laboured so diligently at saving
                  his soul from a problematic purgatory. She was a practical little woman, impatient
                  of speculative theories, and would as soon have entered a cage of wild animals as
                  a spiritualist meeting, or an orgy of holy revival.</p>
               <p>She believed in God, for not to believe in a Divine Intelligence
                  seemed to her a little silly. Surely human wisdom, faulty and feeble though it
                  was, implied some source of fountain-head other than matter. But she had no bent
                  for metaphysics, and, like her ancient forebears, dismissed the thought by saying
                  that whatever the Power that had sustained her through the trials and tribulations
                  of this world, it would do at least as good a job in the next. It concerned her no
                  more than the manifestation of sunlight. You lived, you did the best you could
                  with such talent and strength as heredity and circumstance provided, and you died.
                  That was the sum and substance of existence.</p>
               <p>For me, however, cursed with the same sort of imagination that
                  plagued my father, this vision of Jorun Halson, smiling at the foot of my bed, was
                  not so easily dismissed. Who could say that the little lady might not come again!
                  And if I should see her, would I be so calm and unperturbed as mamma? Diving into
                  my bed at nights, and pulling the sheets up over my head, I doubted it sorely. For
                  what, I wanted to know, was it exactly that mamma did see? She glided in, mamma
                  had said—what, then, of all that business of angels with wings? If you weren’t an
                  angel when you began gliding about visiting your friends, well, then, when did you
                  become an angel? From which thought sprang a dozen others.</p>
               <p>The Last Judgement, for instance. How did that fit into a scheme of
                  things where the disembodied spirit was already flitting about hither and yon, as
                  it listed? Really, it struck me as a decidedly silly parable, without much point,
                  and a complete disregard of common sense. Even I would not bother to drag people
                  back from heaven and hell to judge them, when the judgement merely sent them back
                  to their respective habitations. The more sleep I lost about it, the more certain
                  I grew that papa must be right—and mamma, too, up to a point. The sensible thing
                  was to believe in the immortality of right effort, and to believe what one’s
                  senses revealed as credible.</p>
               <p>Confiding these thoughts to Tilly was not a very fruitful effort.
                  Goodness gracious! Whoever heard of nice people seeing ghosts, or questioning what
                  was written in the Bible! It was a sin. The minister said so. The minister had as
                  little use for spirit phenomena as he had for the doctrines of the Scarlet Woman.
                  Which doctrines, I inferred, were the abhorrent centre of faiths not his own.</p>
               <p>‘But, Tilly,’ I said, ‘what’s the sense of teaching people they
                  have souls that don’t die, and then telling them they are crazy if they see a
                  ghost?’</p>
               <p>‘But a ghost!’ cried Tilly. ‘Goodness gracious, I wish you wouldn’t
                  talk like that. I wish you wouldn’t—it can’t be right. You
                  don’t want to go to hell, do you?’</p>
               <p>‘How do you know there is a hell?’ said I, now firmly set on riding
                  logic to the bitter end. ‘How do you know any of those things are true, any way?
                  Just because somebody said so doesn’t make it so. You don’t believe that devils
                  give people fits do you? Now, do you?’</p>
               <p>‘N—no——’ said Tilly, vaguely, but suspicious.</p>
               <p>‘There you are!’ I crowed, with more villainy than wisdom. ‘That’s
                  in your Bible! It’s full of people full of devils. So there! Now, what do you say
                  to that?’</p>
               <p>‘Oh dear—I wish you wouldn’t talk like that, I really do.’ Poor
                  Tilly was distressed. ‘It’s safer not to think such things.’</p>
               <p>Which maddening remark I had the witlessness to repeat to papa, and
                  got for my pains a cynical retort.</p>
               <p>‘She is perfectly right,’ said he, calmly helping himself to snuff.
                  ‘Matter of fact, not to think at all is a still safer plan. You will find, my
                  dear, that all sensible people like to have everything nicely arranged for them:
                  their little heavens; their little hells; their saints and saviours; all done up
                  in neat compartments, for which pleasures to share they drop a coin in the
                  collection plate.’</p>
               <p>‘Lars! That’s enough,’ said mamma, trying to look severe, though
                  there was a twinkle in her eye. ‘You are talking to a child, remember. Do you want
                  to make her more muddle-headed than she is?’</p>
               <p>‘Well, fish or fowl——’ papa replied. ‘According to your excellent
                  logic, isn’t it better to be completely one thing or another? A perfect
                  dunderhead, for instance, is a joy to behold.’</p>
               <p>‘Oh, go back to your scribbling,’ mamma retorted. ‘And you, Miss,
                  since you’re too lazy to do anything, sit down with a book. That will give you
                  something better to think about.’</p>
               <p>Well, thought I, perhaps it would, if I had not already consumed
                  everything readable about the place. Everything, that is, except a dull and
                  disheartening volume of religious homilies, dedicated to God, and designed, it
                  would seem, to give the reader dyspepsia after his Sabbath meal.</p>
               <p>I was, like every other sentimental soul, to take my plunge into
                  religion by way of salving my wounded ego, but that was still in the future. Just
                  now, I was wanting to be put right on ghosts. The happiest solution was to revert
                  to the Pjodsogur og Munnmaeli, a compilation of folk-tales
                  peppered with all manner of tasty superstitions. Ghosts reared and ramped in that
                  cheerful volume. They dropped down chimneys piece by piece, and stood forth, none
                  the worse for wear. They bounded and haunted sinner and saint alike, and, not
                  seldom, some foresighted minister of the Word made use of a really forceful aftur ganga to plague his enemies. With a spirited command, he
                  sent the lost wraith to poke about bedrooms, rifle butter butts, and bang around
                  the cookhouse, sending kitchen maids into fits. It was all very hair-raising, but
                  not particularly enlightening. I was just as much at sea as before, on the
                  relative status of ghosts, spirits, angels, or whatever thing it was men called
                  their souls, once they had quitted the crooked lanes of life.</p>

               <head>Meeting Destiny</head>
               <p>But though such mysteries filled me with pleasant unrest, they were
                  quickly forgotten in the new excitement that descended on our household. Einar
                  Halson had persuaded papa to buy his house. He had not the heart to continue in
                  this town, now that Jorun was dead. He, too, would try his luck at the coast, and
                  papa might have the house on whatever terms he could afford. Well, think of that!
                  It wasn’t much of a place, to be sure, but it stood on a hill beneath whose stony
                  breast ran a full-throated brook that tumbled over itself to reach the wide blue
                  waters of the St. Louis River. The land on which it stood was part of a sixty-acre
                  tract, and under the agreement of rental you might put in whatever garden you
                  pleased, and could, besides, pasture a dozen cows on the green slips of meadows
                  that threaded through the hills. There were other houses built farther up the
                  slope, where fat German women waddled about in the tangled fields, shooing flocks
                  of geese and fierce ganders that made a furious din, hissing like angry kettles
                  forgotten on a hot stove, and flapping their wings with incredible impertinence.
                  Geese must be a paying proposition, thought papa. He had a good mind to buy a few
                  and become rich.</p>
               <p>‘Frightful creatures!’ cried mamma. No, the thing to do was to get
                  hold of some leghorns and a cow. You knew where you stood with chickens, and the
                  baby had to have fresh milk. Well, dear me, you can imagine how many cups of
                  coffee were consumed before all this tremendous business was settled—how many
                  pancakes mamma had to fry before the few dollars which had been tucked away in a
                  handkerchief box were properly spent. None of us slept very much, for what was the
                  use of spending time so dully when you could be repapering the house, painting the
                  pantry, laying out a garden, and counting a harvest of hens?</p>
               <p>Best of all, for me, was the knowledge that, for years to
                  come—probably for ever and for ever, until our heads were grey, Tilly and I were
                  to be honest-to-goodness neighbours! The idea was so delicious that, in
                  representing it to Tilly, I found myself for the first time so eloquent that we
                  were forced to sit down upon a stone to support the onslaught of so much tender
                  emotion.</p>
               <p>‘For, think of it,’ said I, ‘every single morning we can go to
                  school together. We can be blood sisters, Tilly. We can be faithful and true for
                  ever and ever and ever. We could even read together, if you ever get free of the
                  babies—and if I had anything to read,’ I finished, on a gusty sigh, considerably
                  deflated after my flight of fancy, and suddenly plunging into despair as I
                  reflected that, although a cow and chickens would lend us an air of
                  respectability, they added little to the glamour of life, and nothing whatever to
                  my private happiness. And then it was that Tilly made the first and only
                  spectacular contribution to my painfully unfolding consciousness.</p>
               <p>‘Why don’t you get a card from the library,’ said she, shaking her
                  dear little blonde head, on which a veil of fluffy snowflakes had settled wetly.
                  ‘There’s a nice children’s section. I’ve read all the Dinsmore books, myself.’</p>
               <p>‘What!’ said I, hopping up, and almost choking with excitement.
                  ‘What do you mean, get a card—do you mean, you can borrow books—anybody—just for
                  nothing?’</p>
               <p>‘Sure, why not? That’s what a library is for,’ Tilly replied,
                  looking at me with oblique suspicion, as she often did. Well, for once I did not
                  resent it. How stupid I must seem—what a crazy foreigner.</p>
               <p>‘Dear goodness! Think of it, I didn’t know. And I can read like
                  anything, too!’</p>
               <p>Never was there an adventure like that one, when, in my shabby
                  brown coat, buttoned tightly against the wind and snow, I set out for the local
                  library. It was not much of a place, to be sure, just a long, dingy room in a low,
                  dingy building housing offices and stores, but the moment I opened the door to see
                  before me row on row of books on the unpainted shelves that lined the walls, all
                  to be had for the mere asking, such a flood of emotion filled me that I could only
                  stand there rooted in wonder, my legs like jelly, and the heart in my breast
                  beating like mad. What a sight I must have been in my queer, made-over coat and
                  knitted toque, wet pigtails down my back, like yellow snakes, and heaven knows
                  what sort of dumb expectancy convulsing my round, colourless face. For the
                  shameful truth was, I wanted to bawl—I wanted to howl to the stars. It was
                  suddenly so clear what I wanted most in life, and always would want. And I had
                  wasted seven whole months. Think of it, I could spell out whole words, almost as
                  big as inch worms, even that long ago, and I had not known there were books to be
                  had!</p>
               <p>From somewhere, at a seemingly vast distance, some kind voice
                  spoke, jolting me, red hot and prickly, back to the present.</p>
               <p>‘You want a book, little girl?’</p>
               <p>Want a book? What a question—and how to answer, with a lump as hard
                  as coal in one’s throat? Somehow or other, I managed a squawk that was meant for
                  politeness, and thoroughly ashamed of myself, hurried toward the desk, where a
                  grey-headed lady sat watching me out of kind, very blue eyes.</p>
               <p>‘There is nothing to be afraid of, dear,’ said the voice. Such a
                  kind, low voice. Not at all like most American voices, that even I knew mamma was
                  right in pronouncing shrill and unsympathetic. But, even so, I could not answer
                  because something very queer was happening inside me, some travail of spirit, that
                  had no words for its pain.</p>
               <p>‘You have only to sign a card—you can write, can’t you, dear?’ And
                  a soft hand closed on my faded sleeve, sending a thrill of happiness through my
                  tangled senses.</p>
               <p>Yes, I could write, I managed to mumble, and forthwith proceeded to
                  decorate the precious card with round gobs that looked like tiny eggs strung on a
                  wobbly string. But it made sense. That was the important thing. Laura Goodman, Ramsey Street. For the first time in my life, the funny
                  characters had infinite meaning. They stared up at me from the face of the card,
                  and seemed to say: Now you have really come into being. This is yourself, this
                  string of wobbly ovals. This is your passport into the world of men.</p>
               <p>‘So now you want a book.’ The small, grey lady arose, and the swift
                  rising was like a little wind that blows away the perfume of delicate flowers.
                  Silently, I followed her to the shelves, where the children’s books were stacked.
                  Books with rabbits, and strange-looking animals, and stranger children, disporting
                  on the covers. Pretty books with coloured pictures, and big round print. ‘Here you
                  are,’ said the lady. ‘These are a good beginning for a little girl whose English
                  is still young.’ And she left me, with a smile, to look the treasures over and
                  make my selection.</p>
               <p>That was very nice, of course. But what did I want with rabbits,
                  and pert little hens, I, who had been fed on papa’s heroic narratives and mamma’s
                  proud tales? Little by little, I edged over to the other shelves, and came, at
                  last, to a huge, blue volume, where a man’s austere features arrested my wandering
                  eyes. The Conquests of Julius Caesar. But here was some one I
                  knew! I had wept when papa explained the perfidy of plunging knives into so true a
                  son of liberty! Thrilled to the marrow, I opened the book.</p>
               <p>The closely printed page danced before my eyes. Truth to say, there
                  was scarcely a word that I could understand. Yet there was something here that I
                  wanted, something vital, some proud defiance that captured my fancy. The written
                  word was beyond me, but the pictures were of fighting men, of splendid palaces
                  whose ruins were like broken music, or rare and graceful images, which, even to my
                  child’s mind, expressed the perfection of beauty: poetry of line and motion,
                  crystallized in immortal marble.</p>
               <p>These pictures moved me then, as, indeed, they were destined to
                  move me throughout my bit of time—moved me to a passion to live in this splendid
                  past—to suffer the shocks of turbulent fate, and thrill to those ancient dreams,
                  that even now, refusing death, breathed from these dull pages an irresistibly
                  stirring charm.</p>
               <p>How long I was lost in these pictures I have no way of telling.
                  Several children, and a man in a bulky coon coat, drifted in and out again. But I
                  remained there, locked in a trance that was at once an exquisite rapture and a
                  frightening melancholy. For I was suddenly overborne by the meaning and majesty of
                  books, conscious, for the first time, of the truth of papa’s statement that to be
                  a maker of books was the greatest destiny. Again and again, lifting his tired eyes
                  from some yellowed page, he had paused in his passionate reading to remark with
                  worshipping envy that only a maker of books had the power to immortalize his age.
                  For he it is who gives fame to the great, justice to the vanquished, doom to the
                  traitor; and out of his own troubled hour of life he creates an imperishable
                  fabric that reflects the torment and splendour of his age.</p>
               <p>Yes, I had heard this said so often it had become commonplace, no
                  more arresting than mamma’s strictures about rubbers and cod-liver oil. But now I
                  understood. I understood that even in this one small, unbeautiful room were a
                  hundred empires and a gleaming host of immortals, into which mighty company I
                  might enter at will, thanks to the makers of books. Thanks to the saga-man, who
                  wrote on the walls of time.</p>
               <p>It was more than understanding. It was a conviction that sprang
                  from something deeper than any mental process. It was a feeling that spread like
                  fire through my consciousness. Standing there, rapt as a sleepwalker, an odd
                  figure, surely, in my funny, made-over clothes, I was face to face with my own
                  predestined Vafarlögar—with those fatal flames that quicken
                  desire, and feed upon human vanity and hope.</p>
               <p>In the light of that consuming fire, I could see that nothing in
                  the world mattered, except the faculty to see and to feel and to understand what
                  went on in the world of men, so that it might be caught up at a centre, and called
                  a book. And then, in a blinding flash of terrifying impertinence, the wild thought
                  leaped to my mind.</p>
               <p>‘I too, will write a book, to stand on the shelves of a place like
                  this—and I will write it in English, for that is the greatest language in the
                  whole world!’</p>

               <head>New Worlds to Conquer</head>
               <p>In the ancient writings of China, which are so ripe in usable
                  wisdom, there is a saying which I shall now confess I had meant to take as a
                  lodestar to keep this rambling chronicle from falling into utter confusion. The
                  saying runs something like this: ‘Count not time by the risings and the settings
                  of the sun, nor by the turn of the years, but by those events great or small which
                  have left an indelible impression; for we live not by virtue of length of days but
                  by the brunt of experience.’</p>
               <p>It seems an easy guide, a most simple formula, but alas! like the
                  perfection of most simple things, it requires art of a high order and which
                  therefore now appalls me. And yet the nice economy of arrangement suitable to the
                  novel does not lend itself to this sort of narrative. How easy it would be, and
                  how flattering to vanity, if at this point I could make a tidy cleavage. If,
                  having stumbled into the world of English books and formed in a rash moment a
                  fantastic ambition, I could sail along like a resolute heroine, sure of myself and
                  the future. If, having discovered this wonderland, I could even say that it had
                  brought me nothing but profit and pleasure, how neatly I might patch my quilt of
                  years.</p>
               <p>But nothing could be further from the truth. And truth, permit me
                  to interpolate, is not the same for all of us. No, not even any given circumstance
                  or experience stands in the same relationship to what we call truth, for any one
                  of us.</p>
               <p>After all, there are so many truths, and all of them are
                  fragmentary. Truths, let us say, of the geometric order, which give us the
                  impression of necessity; truths of the physical order, of which we conceive they
                  might be mended; truths of the natural order, more contingent, at a given point,
                  at a given moment in time; and so on, through a thousand speculations. Obviously,
                  we pass from one order of truths to another, and, equally obviously, the character
                  of truth itself changes with the objects affirmed, the speculations dealt in, with
                  the passage of time. Which is merely to say that not only are the most commonplace
                  concepts subject to endless alteration, but even so-called scientific truths never
                  stand still. Everything is relative and subject to the demonstration of evidence.
                  Applied to ordinary beliefs and experience, their sum total of truth as bearing
                  upon ourselves is therefore nothing more nor less than what we can extract from
                  these things for our individual unfoldment and expression. There is no other truth
                  and it is fruitless and foolish to quarrel with any one’s fumbling manipulation of
                  such problematic facts and heterogeneous experiences as come his way.</p>
               <p>We learn a little, I think, chiefly by reason of the intensity of
                  our interests, even though our reasoning may be neither particularly intelligent
                  nor profound. In my own case, it is safe to say that I had at least a healthy
                  curiosity, and a genuine interest in human beings. The daily round had no meaning
                  except in so far as some happening brought out a sharp reaction in myself or
                  others. More especially in others, for, as I have already shown, when I was a
                  child I had little amusement except to watch the behaviour of our friends and
                  acquaintances.</p>
               <p>But now, in the months that followed my discovery of the public
                  library, a painful change took place in my scrambling mental processes. In
                  proportion as I became absorbed in a new type of reading, accepting everything
                  therein as grand and glorious, I began to suspect the austere old tales on which I
                  had been fed.</p>
               <p>More painful still, I began to suffer (what every child of an
                  immigrant race must suffer, I suppose) a vexing doubt of my parents. Certainly
                  they did not behave like the brilliant creatures in these books. What was even
                  more appalling, now that I began to look about me with a searching eye, I soon
                  perceived that in most part we were horribly different from our American
                  neighbours. We had no style. Mamma was as indifferent to the prevailing fashion as
                  she was unimpressed by the manners of Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Smith. When I rushed
                  home in tears because the beauteous daughter of a small contractor snickered at my
                  clothes, all the comfort I got was a thorough scolding for my own ill-bred
                  sensibility. It must be the squire of Ferry-Cot in me! Silly man, he was always
                  vain and wanting to be admired by every fool. One must be above such nonsense.
                  Indeed, people of character were entirely unconscious of trifles of this sort. She
                  was utterly ashamed of me, and set me to patching a flannel petticoat.</p>
               <p>Well, there you see what a nut I had to crack! Why, to begin with,
                  even Tilly did not have to wear flannel petticoats, let alone patch them. The
                  prospect was dreary as a November drizzle. Our house was as un-American as our
                  garments. There was no carpet sprinkled with glowing roses in the parlour. There
                  was no parlour, in fact, but a common room where the slippery sofa, on which I
                  slept, apologized for itself in a shadowy corner and where mamma’s big black
                  bureau, glowering from the opposite wall, defiantly kept the secret of our
                  antiquated finery.</p>
               <p>The chairs, which wandered in and out as the occasion demanded
                  their services elsewhere, were not the sort of pieces visitors marked with awe. It
                  is true that, when the house was paid for, a high-masted organ came to rest
                  between the two tall windows that looked out upon a rather pleasant grassy slope
                  and the tumbling brook, which was the one really beautiful thing in the whole
                  district.</p>
               <p>But the advent of the organ only strengthened my suspicions. It
                  always quarrelled with the bureau, and, moreover, reminded me of Papa Halson’s
                  psalm singing. The contractor’s daughter executed the Black Hawk
                     Waltz and Robin’s Return on a glittering piano that
                  reposed on a bank of red roses.</p>
               <p>There were no pictures on our painted grey walls. We had no vases
                  with spear grass and coloured leaves; no wreaths of wax flowers lay under a
                  crystal dome on our haphazard table, which held, instead, a trio of plants that
                  bloomed the year round. Nor had we any bric-à-brac, cockle shells, or cupids—all
                  that mamma’s cabinet boasted were cups and saucers, plates and pots, and a berry
                  dish with a plain green border. It was very disheartening. Wherever I looked, our
                  foreignness shrieked at me. We were hopelessly Icelandic, and doubtless doomed to
                  remain so to the end of time. Mamma was not likely to be influenced by what I told
                  her of Mollie MacDonald’s house, even though her papa had the contract for the new
                  meat market on Central Avenue. Though I were to outbabble the brook, I could never
                  convince my parent of the importance of conformity with popular fashions, nor make
                  her see the horrid crime of being different.</p>
               <p>Nor could I expect much help from papa. Novel ideas intrigued him,
                  it is true, and he might have grown enthusiastic over a tortuous system of
                  breathing, or a new heresy with regard to Original Sin, but to tatting on the
                  towels and flying birds on the pillow shams he would have remained indifferent, if
                  not totally oblivious.</p>
               <p>Indeed, I had ample reason to suspect that dear papa attached so
                  little importance to such things that you might have set the kitchen range in the
                  front room, and the organ in the shed, for all he cared. He might have thought it
                  uncomfortable, and a trifle queer, perhaps, but not half so queer as the doctrine
                  of the Trinity, and the Plan of Salvation. Any such topsy-turvy arrangement he
                  would have accepted quite cheerfully as the normal aberration of human conduct,
                  which always ran to fetish and feverish worship of the ridiculous.</p>
               <p>But that it was really momentously significant to hang curtains of
                  Nottingham lace at the windows and perch a plaster shepherdess on a nervous
                  pedestal he could never have seen. All this you may be sure caused me no end of
                  bitter cogitation, for I had the gloomy intuition that I should have to fight
                  alone for some semblance of modernity and American culture. And, to make
                  everything worse, the books I read so avidly led me to suspect that all was not
                  well even with the contractor’s daughter—there was something not altogether
                  convincing in her superior attitudes, and though I should have greatly rejoiced
                  over a green carpet with purple dandelions, I was not quite easy in my mind that
                  such a choice represented the last word in perfection.</p>
               <p>I still derived peculiar joy from the barren halls and long fires
                  of the Norsemen. Nevertheless, I was determined to take myself in hand and,
                  starting with the outside, make the best of a sad situation. The logical first
                  step was to get rid of my frightful clothes. Here was I, bottled up in prim
                  poplins, unadorned as an egg, while all the decent little American misses billowed
                  about in frills.</p>
               <p>My battle with mamma ended characteristically. If her dressmaking
                  did not please me, I was entirely free to do better myself, said she. In fact,
                  there was no earthly reason why my superior wisdom and taste should languish
                  unseen.</p>
               <p>That was a bit of a dilemma, I must confess, and the best I could
                  do was beg a few coins of papa, and, calling upon the angels, I let the scissors
                  take their course through the spotted brillianteen which was to clothe me in grace
                  and beauty.</p>
               <p>Well, there is this to be said about that remarkable creation, it
                  certainly puffed! It was so agreeably free-and-easy that in a high wind it might
                  readily have been mistaken for a gay and giddy balloon.</p>
               <p>But, sad to say, a floating garment does not make a free mind. It
                  seemed that I had exchanged my prim poplin for a prudish spirit. I could no longer
                  enjoy anything for its own sake—I was much too occupied with the discouraging
                  business of acquiring respectable scruples. Where formerly, as I have tried to
                  show, existence, even at its worst, had a romantic flavour, because I had accepted
                  it as a series of astonishing events, life was now become a most confusing tangle
                  of social commandments.</p>
               <p>As may be imagined, my passionate desire to become an unspotted
                  American would not permit any question of these things. The less sense they made
                  and the more they conflicted with my natural inclinations, the more certain I was
                  of their sanctity. Consequently I contracted a virulent and lingering type of the
                  comparison mania. Everything I had valued and enjoyed underwent a dubious
                  dissecting. I perceived, for instance, how scandalously unprogressive,
                  inefficient, and disorderly the poor Halsons had been, and though I had wept to
                  see them depart, I was moved to thankfulness that I should no longer be lured by
                  the Sunday chocolate to endanger my own future. The same was true of Katie. I
                  still loved her, but I shuddered to think how joyously I had joined her and Mamma
                  Pepolenski in their last berry-picking orgy, for no lovelier reason than to peddle
                  our harvest from door to door.</p>
               <p>Heaven help me! So crude was my orientation at the time (and this
                  only last year, mind you!) that I had actually thought it a capital adventure.
                  Panting up the hill-side in tow of fat Mamma Pepolenski, whose agility was
                  incredible, I had felt myself treading diamonds instead of dew and heading
                  straight into the red eye of the rising sun. And, with two little pails strung
                  from a cord round my middle, I had tasted the delectable thrill of competition, as
                  I valiantly, but in vain, attempted to keep pace with Katie as we stripped the
                  tall raspberry bushes of their glowing spoils.</p>
               <p>Yes, I had even thought it marvellously enterprising to traipse
                  behind her sturdy figure as she offered this sun-born gift to the haggling ladies
                  of the town. Dear me, how fortunate it was that the Pepolenskis had gone back to
                  Poland, where, it is to be hoped, Katie found the good husband for whom she had
                  prepared herself so well, and laid away in tissue her ankle-length veil.</p>
               <p>Now all such robust vulgarities had come under a fearful ban, for I
                  had come to a point where I innocently imagined that the hurdy-gurdy going round
                  in my head was solemn thinking. I had reached the trying stage where I no longer
                  reacted naturally to the common scene, but must, forsooth, listen to the carping
                  of a timid, inner mentor. I no longer enjoyed, as once I had done, the cheery
                  spectacle of old Mrs. Scheider, as she came waddling over the brow of the hill,
                  shooing her pearl-grey geese before her, as shrill a scold as her fiercest gander.
                  Oh, no, I was much too conscious that her tough old feet were bare and her high
                  round stomach unrestrained by a respectable corset! The kindly old world was no
                  longer just an interesting place full of queer people who behaved with enchanting
                  idiocy—it was fast becoming an appalling problem, which, in spite of its
                  ‘orneriness’, must be solved on strictly American lines.</p>
               <p>For this brilliant assumption I had, of course, a perfect
                  authority: my beautiful, slim-waisted, pompadoured school-teacher.</p>
               <p>Perhaps it was the pompadour that made her seem so high-minded, as
                  though she kept a bolster of wisdom tucked on top of her head, ready for all
                  eventualities. Certainly, she did her best to elevate the assorted savages under
                  her discipline. We hailed the flag with less indifference under her shining
                  example, and never doubted that in the land of liberty for which it waved in the
                  breeze we were all free and equal. In a vague way, I recollect that our easy
                  conversion to this pleasant myth had something to do with the Pilgrim Fathers. Nor
                  was this surprising, for, whenever Miss Brent found occasion to orate upon this
                  remarkable set of fathers, her smooth pompadour seemed to swell with golden
                  satisfaction, and something very like a purr crept into her exultant voice.</p>
               <p>Even I, who thus early thought but little of the domestic virtues,
                  was carried away with wondering amazement at their peculiar accomplishments.</p>
               <p>Never before had I even imagined that such a sober lot of men could
                  have left behind them anything faintly glamorous. But, somehow or other, Miss
                  Brent created this happy impression as she recounted their exploits with bated
                  breath. They had subdued The Wilderness! One saw the forest melting away like snow
                  before their determined tread—simply whisking away into nothingness, and
                  civilization in the shape of meeting-houses, stocks, and gallows popping up in its
                  stead. Piety was the mainspring of all these miracles—indeed, it left me gasping.
                  The Pilgrim Fathers not only bore with equanimity the struggle for daily
                  existence, but gladly supported the chill of the meeting-house, where they praised
                  the Lord from morning to night. Now, that was something! I tried it, and failed
                  abysmally before the day was half spent.</p>
               <p>Other wonders they accomplished with equal facility. They converted
                  the Indians, and invented pumpkin pies. Yes, even jack-o’-lanterns were their
                  idea, said Miss Brent, a trifle apologetically, and hastened on to more impressive
                  examples.</p>
               <p>Under Pilgrim guidance, the skittery female somewhat redeemed her
                  sex. Abigail, Mary, and Mehitabel applied themselves to the loom and the distaff,
                  and cheerfully filled the cradles and the graveyard, thereby leaving us the
                  imperishable precept of righteous mothers in Israel. Naturally, wantons and
                  witches were dealt with as beseemed a godly people who had left the sinful shores
                  of England to plant the flag of liberty on the rockbound coasts of Maine.</p>
               <p>Of course, these concrete examples only served to show that Divine
                  Providence had predestined the moral tone of the future republic. Even the most
                  backward and barbarous among us must realize that the Pilgrim Fathers had stamped
                  their sterling character upon the fabric of the nation. They had laboured as
                  instruments of fate for those who were to come after them—yes, for even those of
                  us who, like Ishmael, were of doubtful origin. And how they had laboured! Pretty
                  Miss Brent folded her arms across a dainty bosom and transfixed us with luminous
                  blue eyes. Why, think of it, with only scratchy chicken quills, the dear old
                  things had penned reams of homilies for the uplift of the colony and females in
                  particular. In the midst of subduing the wilderness, they had actually found time
                  to settle the line of my lady’s dress and fix the number of bows on her bonnet! In
                  the same humble spirit they had studied the ways of the heathen and thereby
                  learned the secret of planting the yellow maize, and the fine art of eating corn
                  on the cob. They had tamed the wild turkey—tamed, too, the obstreperous spirits of
                  the young by inventing the courting trumpet. Such mundane matters out of the way,
                  the fine flower of their genius was free to concentrate upon a multiplicity of
                  rules for human conduct, to the ends that even a fool should have found it
                  difficult to err, bounded by so many safeguarding prohibitions.</p>
               <p>Well, well, it was all most remarkable, and we were certainly glad
                  that the sturdy little Mayflower survived the bounding billows
                  to fetch such a cargo of piety and wisdom to these darkened shores.</p>
               <p>To be strictly truthful, however, there were dark moments when I
                  saw quite clearly my thorough unfitness for adoption into such a meritorious
                  fraternity. My ancestors, remote and near, had never shown much humility, and I
                  had the horrid feeling that any Norseman who might have dared to dictate his
                  lady’s shift would have found himself among the shades of Helja’s halls in no time
                  at all. Obviously, as a race, we not only laughed at laws, but were woefully
                  lacking in modesty. Even mamma, with her stern rectitude, never dreamed of washing
                  her intimate garments in a hidden pool like the pious matrons of old Boston Town.
                  Not she! They flapped in the sun for all to see, and something told me that even
                  the passage of the President would have given mamma no alarm. On the contrary, she
                  would have expected the August Eye to brighten on beholding such a fine example of
                  sun-bleaching.</p>
               <p>Other offences stared me in the face. Heretofore, I had suffered no
                  qualms when mamma poured a nip of brandy in papa’s coffee on a frosty morning, nor
                  realized the enormity of growing merry over a bottle of port on New Year’s Eve.
                  But now, of course, I must mend my ways—eschew, as far as possible, the
                  reprehensible manners of my mistaken forebears. Whatever the cost, I simply must
                  become an upright and useful member of the Great Republic.</p>
               <p>Tilly sympathized with my ambition. The problem was, to find a
                  logical starting-place. With so many perverse notions in my head, she suggested
                  that the Elsie Dinsmore classics might help me to see the light. Elsie, she
                  assured me, was exactly the kind of girl the Pilgrim Fathers would have approved.
                  Why, even the Lutheran minister, who frowned upon all novels as inventions of
                  dissolute and idle minds, found no fault in Elsie.</p>
               <p>I flew for the book, and got for my speed a blighting experience.
                  The sweet little darling of that tremendously popular series affected me like cold
                  porridge. With the best will in the world, I simply could not see any particular
                  virtue in dear little Elsie’s sitting on a piano-stool until she fainted, rather
                  than play the waltz tune her worldly papa demanded on a Sunday. To tell the truth,
                  when the wicked man repented of his folly and was duly converted at the bedside of
                  his pale angel, I lost heart completely. There was not the slightest use fooling
                  myself any longer that such tender sensibilities were within my spiritual
                  province. I must watch for something less dainty on which to feed my hungry
                  ego.</p>
               <p>The glorious opportunity fairly leaped at me when the village
                  drunkard slit his throat—from ear to ear, mind you, and no half-way measure. Now,
                  there was something to tickle the nerve ends and try moral fibre.</p>
               <p>‘Heaven save us! What a sight to see!’ giggled Stina, who brought
                  the news. ‘Just picture it, Mrs. Goodman! Lying stark and stiff in his own gore,
                  and not a soul to care! To think what some of us come to in this wicked
                  world.’</p>
               <p>Good old Stina had by now joined the hill community, and each
                  evening she came floating down the stony path that led to our door to fetch the
                  quart of milk mamma always set aside for her, and rarely did she fail to bring
                  some morsel of gossip. As might be expected, the milk required a preliminary drop
                  of coffee to spur her up the hill again with the green lard pail. But this was
                  more than gossip—ja, sure, it was life at its worst, and the devil’s doing! So
                  there she sat, chirping away in the tone—slightly chill and breathless—she thought
                  suitable to sorrow and tribulation. In so far as was possible to such a happy
                  human magpie, her mien was sternly serious.</p>
               <p>‘Sure, it’s a terrible thing,’ said she, shaking her head and
                  reaching for a rolled pancake, ‘a terrible, terrible thing, even for a sinner
                  bereft of his senses by alcohol, to lie forlorn, and lost, with not a soul
                  caring—with none to shed a pitying tear.’</p>
               <p>There was the gallant mission for you! Something more commendable
                  than pining away on a piano-stool. I must shed that pitying tear. In fact, I could
                  feel the moisture pressing upon my eyelids the moment the thought was born, for
                  you must know I instantly saw myself drooping above the dead, shedding the soft,
                  benignant tear. It was a very moving idea.</p>
               <p>But, alas, hard on the heels of the beautiful vision came the
                  chilling recollection that here was no ordinary death. On sober reflection, I saw
                  the feasibility of a little moral support. I still wanted to weep for the lone,
                  lorn sinner, but after all, the deed would be doubly glorious shared with another.
                  There was no use offering the opportunity to Tilly. Something told me that Mrs.
                  Rhinertson would frown upon any connection with suicide. She was a respectable
                  church woman. No one worked harder at a rummage sale, or baked better pies for the
                  thanksgiving festivals. She, nor her offspring, had little need to rush into the
                  alleys of life to perform an act of grace. Laura J. was a better prospect.</p>
               <p>To begin with, the Johnsons were a funny lot—so said the
                  neighbours. Mr. Johnson was a noisy, virile woodsman, who literally blew into the
                  house on his infrequent visits, roared at Laura (who was a stepdaughter) in
                  good-natured bluster, tossed his own progeny about like balls, and drove his poor
                  wife nearly crazy. How such a morose and melancholy female had ever captured his
                  fancy was a complete mystery. In the five years of my close friendship with Laura
                  I never once heard her mother laugh, express a cheerful opinion, or even agree to
                  anything whatsoever. She moved about the house in a perpetual miasma of irritable
                  gloom, attacking every bit of work with a kind of suppressed fury, and saying
                  nothing until some inner geyser erupted, and brought a sharp staccato reprimand to
                  her thin, colourless lips.</p>
               <p>Between mother and daughter the queerest of relationships
                  persisted. A sort of honorable undeclared warfare. In everything save mutual
                  stubbornness, they were poles apart. Young Laura was tender-hearted, erratic, gay.
                  The mother affected you like a cold vinegar compress. The warmest emotion shrank
                  to zero under the chilly sting of her mere presence. Yet the poor lady must once
                  have possessed some fatal charm to acquire a double dose of husband and five
                  boiling progeny.</p>
               <p>Laura had her own peculiar method of attack. Bouncing into the
                  kitchen, she announced stentoriously: ‘I’m going to L.G.’s, ma.’</p>
               <p>No sound from ma, but the banging of a pot lid, or the thumping of
                  a swishing broom.</p>
               <p>‘Ma! I’m going to L.G.’s, I tell you—I’m going for supper.’</p>
               <p>Still the screaming silence.</p>
               <p>‘Ma! Ma!——’</p>
               <p>‘Am I deaf, crazi ungi!’ (‘Crazy
                  youngster’.)</p>
               <p>‘Well, I’m going! Do you want me to do anything first?’</p>
               <p>‘You are not! Fetch some kindling, and be quiet!’</p>
               <p>‘Sure, ma, but what’s the matter with that lump, Ole? Can’t he do
                  something?’</p>
               <p>No reply, naturally, nor did Laura expect it. Blythe and bouncing,
                  she filled the kindling basket, and then, instantly assuming her embattled
                  expression, returned to the attack.</p>
               <p>‘Well, I’m going, ma.’</p>
               <p>‘I said not. Be quiet.’</p>
               <p>‘Ma—I’m going.’</p>
               <p>Valiant sniff from the corner of the room, where ma was angrily
                  kneading a mess of bannock.</p>
               <p>‘Good-bye, ma!’ shouted her daughter, straightening her tam, which
                  was always shifting to one ear. Not a word from ma, only a perceptible thickening
                  of the atmosphere.</p>
               <p>‘Good-bye, ma!’ roared the persistent child,
                  bounding for the door, and rattling the cracked knob. ‘GOOD-BYE, MAMMA!’</p>
               <p>Then, in final, but honourable surrender, ma returned the roar:
                     ‘Good-bye—crazi ungi!’</p>
               <p>This curious method of procedure never varied. The silent, soured
                  woman always said no to every proposal, and never once succeeded in keeping her
                     crazi ungi from doing exactly as she pleased. The moment the
                  door shut behind her, Laura beamed upon the world, cheerful as a cricket. For the
                  moment she was the victor, and all was well.</p>
               <p>In the end, this everlasting friction, gloom, and struggle, bore a
                  bitter harvest which, unfortunately, neither the acid mother had wisdom to
                  foresee, nor the victim of her perverseness sufficient guidance to escape.</p>
               <p>But that is to borrow from the future. At the present time neither
                  Laura nor I took the daily round very deeply to heart. We were much too busy with
                  our own emotions, and a new and sharpened awareness of the world. When I gave any
                  thought, beyond a half-alarmed wonder, to those curious scenes, it was to reflect
                  that Mrs. Johnson was like thunder, noisy, but ineffectual, whereas mamma was like
                  lightning—and pity the poor object she wished to annihilate!</p>
               <p>Well, you will see that the neighbours had some justice on their
                  side. The Johnsons were queer enough; which, for my present purpose, was rather an
                  asset. I had only to suggest that Mamma Johnson would undoubtedly disapprove our
                  charitable excursion to be sure of Laura’s passionate support. Otherwise, knowing
                  her to be full of morbid notions under her surface gaiety—screaming with terror at
                  the sight of a dead gopher, and thoroughly convinced of the reality of ghosts—even
                  my best persuasion might utterly fail me.</p>
               <p>So that was the unscrupulous line I followed. Laura gave a sharp
                  yelp at mention of the suicide, but the moment I mentioned her mother’s possible
                  objection, her mind was made up. The idea was crazy, but of course she’d go. She
                  had as much right to make a fool of herself as I. So far so good, thought I. Yet
                  it would never do to take along such a sceptic. Besides, my romantic instincts
                  were cruelly wounded. Was it foolish, said I, to show ourselves merciful towards
                  this forlorn sinner who lay forsaken and forsworn in the undertaker’s parlour? How
                  would she like to be left like that without so much as a single flower on her
                  breast, or a solitary tear shed above her bier?</p>
               <p>Laura wept as easily as she raged. ‘Gosh! I never thought of that.
                  You say the darndest things, L.G.’ Whereupon I strained my noble efforts, drawing
                  upon Stina’s touching vocabulary to such an extent that we both sat down on a
                  boulder behind our barn and wept deliciously.</p>
               <p>Our better natures thus firmly to the fore, we finally resolved to
                  scour the neighbourhood for posies. White asters would be most fitting, we
                  thought, with just a touch of scarlet to strike a tragic note, and a background of
                  asparagus fern to give our bouquet a professional touch. Old Mrs. Scheider had a
                  huge asparagus bed, and a bank of sweet-william under the kitchen window. She was
                  rather a nice old lady, even though she walked about in bare feet the colour of
                  baked mud.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Scheider received us with beaming enthusiasm. Ach, Himmel! So we felt sorry for the poor man who cut his throat? Good
                  hearts we had—we should have a handful of fresh pretzels for such a pretty
                  thought. And all the flowers we wanted. Oh, but weren’t we scared? Such a corpse
                  was not a pretty sight?</p>
               <p>The pretzels were nice and salty, the flowers all we could have
                  desired, yet it must be owned that a chilly gravity descended upon us when we left
                  the Scheider yard and turned our steps towards town. By the time we reached
                  Recktor’s Parlours (which was a gloomy, one-story building appropriately opposite
                  a flourishing saloon) neither of us dared to look at the other. The same, horrid
                  expectation shook us both. Left to individual inclination, we should have bolted,
                  but pride is stronger than cowardice. There was nothing for it but to turn the
                  clammy knob, and plunge into the dark terror behind that dreadful door.</p>
               <p>What was this? No dead strewn about? No miles of coffins? Just a
                  pleasant, tidy room, with varnished chairs in rows. Two healthy ferns beside a
                  table, and a little folding organ in the dark corner. Not even a cavernous clerk.
                  A curtained window at the back let in a stream of white autumnal sunshine. There
                  was a scent of incense in the air! Quite an ordinary little man, with a mild blue
                  eye, tidy fringe of hair round the pale pancake of his scalp, and neatly waxed
                  moustache, materialized suddenly to ask us in mildest tone the nature of our
                  errand.</p>
               <p>Exactly what tumbled from our stiffened lips I cannot say. Some
                  sort of trembling duo about the poor suicide and the posies, which I thrust
                  forward in great haste.</p>
               <p>‘Oh——’ exclaimed the little man, with, I thought, an unbecoming
                  humour quickening his glance. ‘How very thoughtful—you will want to place them
                  yourselves, of course.’</p>
               <p>O Vision of the Pitying Tear, how far and fast it had flown. ‘No!
                  No!’ I wanted to shout, but that sly twinkle, for now I was sure it was a derisive
                  twinkle, decided me.</p>
               <p>‘Of course,’ I repeated, with what I imagined a perfect imitation
                  of mamma upholding the honour of her ancestors.</p>
               <p>Believe me, it was a bad moment. Glancing at my gallant partner, I
                  perceived that her habitual sallow hue was now peculiarly vivid, as though some
                  elemental sprite had poured pea-soup under her skin, and the glassy stare of her
                  eyes was anything but enheartening. However, I had always a mean sort of tenacity,
                  which, early and late, has stood me in good stead.</p>
               <p>‘Come along, L. J.,’ said I, grabbing her arm, and making after the
                  little man, whose very back, it seemed to me, quivered with challenging
                  amusement.</p>
               <p>At the threshold of the terrible door he suddenly fell back, and,
                  moving aside, motioned us to enter. Well, there was no escape now. None whatever.
                  Unless the angel Michael did us a swift and saintly favour, we must go on with the
                  bluff, and drape our garden flowers on that hideous breast. For, of course, we
                  must have expected, and, perhaps, in our savage soul, really secretly hoped for
                  the worst.</p>
               <p>So how to explain our mingled feelings when the poor dead lay at
                  last before our wild young eyes, I do not know. For here was no ghastly sight, but
                  a quiet, most painfully respectable gentleman. Not a hair out of place, his
                  greying moustachios sprucely turned, and a gleaming expanse of starched
                  shirtfront, on which I hastily laid my floral token. He might have been the
                  Lutheran pastor lying in state, so well had the city, which let him starve in the
                  gutter, made amends now that it was too late.</p>
               <p>Outside, we frankly bolted, running like a pair of frightened
                  hounds back to the comfort of our shaggy hills.</p>
               <p>‘Gosh!’ wheezed my faithful sidekick, as we clambered upon a good
                  grey boulder, where we could swing our legs and look down the shining runway of
                  the creek that skirted papa’s turnip patch. ‘Gosh darn, I never
                  was so scared! And to think it was all for nothing—they must have sewed him up
                  neat as a sock!’</p>
               <p>Which ended the matter, for we discovered that we had a cent
                  between us, and decided that a couple of liquorice sticks would soothe our rumpled
                  nerves and set the world to rights.</p>

            <div>
               <head>Adolescent Conditioning</head>
               <p>This put an end to our pretensions towards charitable grief. I
                  think we all fell in love—and not only our threesome, but every other girl in the
                  class. The object of our passion was a new student who, in addition to having a
                  fascinating profile, played the piano with dash and tremendously impressive
                  gestures. His name was Simon, and all I now remember of him with tenderness is,
                  that on Valentine’s day I was the happy recipient of a pinkish card that bore
                  flattering erasures testifying to our hero’s romantic struggles. Patently, it had
                  first been intended for Laura J., but wound up with my initials instead. I am glad
                  to say that I had the fortitude to refrain from drawing attention to this amazing
                  fact, although, quite naturally, I slept with the precious missive under my pillow
                  for at least a week. After which, I am sorry to confess, we had an unholy scrap
                  about Swedes and Norwegians, which ended all heart throbs. Simon was a Swede, and
                  not unnaturally, took it amiss when I quoted Olaf Trygvasson’s opinion of his
                  Swedish enemies: Swedes, said the great king, were not to be trusted, for in guile
                  they were almost the equal of Danes!</p>
               <p>Well, poor Simon might have forgiven me even this if, to clinch my
                  argument, I had not reminded him about the erasures on the Valentine. Even in love
                  you could never tell which way a Swede would jump, said I, and flounced off,
                  leaving Simon to the softer graces of Molly MacDonald.</p>
               <p>What stings of conscience I may have had were soon forgotten. The
                  complex business of growing up was too engrossing for any one twitter of emotion
                  to hold the stage long. We three inseparables, Laura J., Tilly, and I, held many a
                  counsel on the good old sun-baked rocks in our back-yard, tackling everything
                  under the sun with sublime confidence in our ability to hit upon the right
                  solution. Mostly, these orations had to do with the shining futures we meant to
                  carve out for ourselves, and our individual reactions to what we mistook for a
                  precocious grasp of life.</p>
               <p>Foolish though we were, and buoyed up by all sorts of sentimental
                  trash, we none the less understood quite thoroughly that none of us would have an
                  easy time attaining our simplest ambitions. Laura wanted to go to a business
                  college, but where on earth was the money to come from? In a household where there
                  never were enough decent shoes to go round, and a joint of meat had to serve for
                  six different stews, was it likely she’d get any help from that quarter? When she
                  finished grammar school she meant to go to work. The match factory paid five
                  dollars a week, and even after paying board she hoped to save towards her
                  ambition. Tilly wanted to go to work too, but not to save money, but to spend it
                  fixing up the house. To get a carpet, and curtains, and new chairs—and a girl had
                  to have some nice corner to entertain her friends. Tilly’s idea of perpetual bliss
                  was founded on the Dinsmore myth. Mine was the most fantastic dream of all.</p>
               <p>I, if you please, wanted a college education. It would all be very
                  simple. I had only to finish the ninth grade, take a year of Normal (possible
                  then), and teach my way to glory and renown. It was a dream I kept bright, as I
                  washed the kitchen floor of a Saturday, shined the lamp chimneys, and renewed the
                  pink rags in the fat belly of the parlour lamp. Yet there were weak moments when I
                  wondered if being a fairly good student were all it was cracked up to be.</p>
               <p>Molly MacDonald was such a dud in class that she couldn’t conjugate
                  a verb without choking on her teeth, but she was going to finishing school next
                  winter to fit herself for the kind of profession Tilly coveted, and would never
                  embrace. Not because Molly had a sweeter nature, or the maternal heart, but
                  because Molly’s papa was now in politics, and, consequently, picked off the
                  biggest civic contracts. I understood that clearly enough—as clearly as I
                  understood how surely Mr. MacDonald attributed his successful chiselling to the
                  grace of God.</p>
               <p>It would seem that nature, by way of compensating for many
                  deficiencies had generously sprinkled my natal dust with the wholesome salt of
                  scepticism. Which might have served me well, had I not betrayed the gift and
                  followed instead the foolish lure of impossible ideals. Even at this early stage I
                  suspected the weakness of the pretty sentiments peddled out for our edification—be
                  good, sweet maid; kind hearts are more than coronets; virtue is its own reward,
                  etc., etc. Nevertheless, I wanted to believe in this nonsense, and tried,
                  therefore, with amusing silliness, to emulate the Sacred Monkeys, seeing no evil,
                  hearing no evil, speaking no evil.</p>
               <p>Destiny and desire are not always compatible. The comfortable
                  blinkers that most sweet souls wear throughout life, to the exclusion of
                  distressing realities, were not to be my portion; nor yet the soothing cotton wool
                  of indisputable conviction that shuts out all contrary thought. Whatever my
                  predilection, I had to see and experience no end of things that the average
                  individual knows only by hearsay, or not at all.</p>
               <p>There came an unforgettable day that was to leave an indelible
                  impression. Mamma, who had always great pleasure in sharing anything she had with
                  others, sent me with a quart of Jersey cream to my aunt, who, by now, had
                  transformed her house into a cottage hospital. She was getting on in years, and
                  found it arduous to continue her rounds in every sort of weather. Gone, naturally,
                  was the handsome minister, and gone, too, the former atmosphere of intimacy. The
                  homeliest place was the kitchen, where a variety of housemaids presided,
                  untroubled by snooping interference.</p>
               <p>But, on this day, when I stepped into the cheery room out of a
                  golden autumn sunshine, I was instantly oppressed by a feeling of freighted
                  tension. The cook was nowhere about, nor were there, at the moment, any sounds of
                  activity. Thinking the girl was busy upstairs, I put the cream in the pantry, and
                  then, every nerve jittery, tiptoed through my aunt’s private quarters. I was just
                  on the point of mounting the stairs when a sudden piercing shriek rooted me to the
                  spot.</p>
               <p>My impulse was to flee, but my feet refused to move. What followed
                  was so hideous, I felt as though my own flesh were riddled and torn with a battery
                  of javelins. The sudden assault upon the nerves was nothing compared with the
                  subsequent shock of horror when the significance of these ghastly cries flashed
                  upon me. Everything in me revolted, every quivering sense rebelling hotly against
                  this obscene anguish at the roots of life. Yes, now I understood what was going on
                  up there. What, my terrified mind told me, was going on and on and on all over the
                  whole wide world. A shambles of suffering, senseless and cruel. And, I thought
                  with fierce loathing, no life was worth such a trial of suffering.</p>
               <p>I wanted to run, to hide for ever from such hideous reality. But to
                  save my soul, I couldn’t stir. I sat there paralysed in shameful misery and
                  vicarious pain. Oh, would it never end, never, never be over and done!</p>
               <p>Why didn’t my aunt put a stop to those unspeakable wails! Oh, I was
                  soon to learn how much more insufferable the sounds of spent and dying energy can
                  be. The poor, tormented voice lost all its human quality, changed to hoarse,
                  inarticulate, animal groanings, that made me long to howl in horrid sympathy.
                  Then, in a wild burst of reviving consciousness, the hateful sounds shaped to
                  piteous clarity:</p>
               <p>‘Dear Jesus, save me! Save me! Jesus! Jesus——’</p>
               <p>Almost simultaneously, the door opened, and, dreadful to behold,
                  there stood my aunt, slumped against the edge of the door, broken, beaten, such a
                  look on her face as I shall never forget.</p>
               <p>O God, I thought, now all was lost! When that tower of human
                  strength hung there, defeated, what hope remained for the pitiful sufferer. But
                  Haldora Olson was not the kind of woman to support defeat. Only a moment or two,
                  she steadied herself, breathing heavily, summoning all of her flagging forces with
                  eyes shut, with lips a ridge of drawn purple in a strong, outjutting chin. Then,
                  with a quick lift of the shoulders, as though to unseat weariness and fear, back
                  she marched to the grim battle.</p>
               <p>I cannot say, for time had lost its meaning, how long thereafter it
                  was that Berta, the cook, came streaking out of the room with a bundle in her
                  arms, and the tears streaming down her face. I don’t suppose anything could have
                  surprised her after such an experience. A fainting youngster cringing on the
                  stairs occasioned no concern. Catching sight of me, she fairly yelled in
                  triumph:</p>
               <p>‘She pulled her through! She saved them both! Dear Lord, I never
                  saw such a woman!’</p>
               <p>Feeling very small and insignificant I crept out into the mellow
                  twilight, but with a warmth of pride about the heart—a beat of stirring happiness
                  in my frightened breast.</p>
               <p>I had plumbed the ugliest fears in an overwhelming realization of
                  menacing death. Those awful moments were often to infest my dreams, awake and
                  asleep, but always the sturdy figure of my aunt came to the rescue. Life was full
                  of terrors, that I perceived, but courage, plain human courage, was a force that
                  worked miracles. And now, too, I could appreciate the answer my aunt once made to
                  a pious dame who was taking her to task for laxity in church attendance.</p>
               <p>Said the lady: ‘Surely you have some thought for the after-life?
                  Have you not considered that you must render an account at the judgement
                  seat?’</p>
               <p>‘Sure,’ said my aunt, with jovial patience. ‘If old Peter gets
                  obstreperous at the Gate, I’ll wave my forceps under his nose. That, I think, will
                  silence the old fellow!’</p>
               <p>But to go on with my tale. That experience seemed to usher me into
                  an entirely new world—a world I frantically sought to dodge by burying myself in
                  books more deeply than ever. I found my escape in the nature poetry of Bryant, and
                  used to go mooning about the hill-side, or sit for stolen hours in some cranny of
                  rocks overhanging the brook, mumbling Thanatopsis, and The Ages, growing sweetly tearful over some noble savage in
                  chains. Yet even this device could not for long stop or stem the natural curiosity
                  that prodded and pricked my mind.</p>
               <p>The rhythm of verse was an enchantment less fascinating than the
                  mystery of life. I began to see human beings in a different light; for the first
                  time I was conscious that the really interesting thing about any one is not what
                  he seems at any given moment, but what he represents in the sum total of his
                  experience. I was still very much of a child, and thoroughly enjoyed the surprise
                  parties that were the order of the day, but, in the midst of such a lark, I would
                  suddenly find myself worrying about Mrs. Peterson and Mrs. Berg, and even Simon’s
                  antics at the piano would lose significance. And again fate conspired to feed my
                  curiosity. In quick succession a number of events befell, each one contributing
                  its lasting impression.</p>
               <p>To begin with, that case at the hospital became a sort of village
                  wonder, discussed everywhere with varying emphasis. It was commonly agreed that my
                  aunt had performed a miracle, but that it was rather a pity the effort had not
                  been expended in a better cause. For Olga was an unmarried mother, you see, and,
                  as a woman of thirty-eight, should have known better.</p>
               <p>Which was doubtless true, yet neither the sinner nor my aunt seemed
                  to think the situation called for sackcloth and ashes, although Olga had not a
                  cent to pay for her care.</p>
               <p>‘Oh, I expected that,’ said my aunt. ‘Look here, my girl, can you
                  cook a decent meal?’</p>
               <p>‘God love you, how do you suppose I got myself into this mess!’
                  exclaimed the beaming miscreant. ‘Sure, it’s the black truth, you can cook
                  yourself to what a man calls his heart. If it’s a cook you want, Mrs. Olson, I can
                  pay off a dozen babies in no time at all.’</p>
               <p>So Olga remained, not only a month or two, as so many others were
                  to do, but for three years, presiding with energy and dispatch over the big
                  kitchen—cheered to the marrow, as she used to say, by the sight of her little
                  Stanley tumbling about the floor. A more amiable creature never fell from grace.
                  In the end, aunt got so fond of her that she gave way to occasional grim
                  forebodings.</p>
               <p>‘I can’t think why the Lord made a woman like that!’ she’d say
                  angrily. ‘No hips at all! I hope the creature has sense enough not to marry.’</p>
               <p>Which was asking too much of an optimist like Olga. One day she met
                  a farmer from northern Wisconsin, a very decent man, who accepted little Stanley
                  without comment, and Olga thought herself the luckiest of women to have found a
                  kind father for her nameless son. Two years later she died in childbed.</p>
               <p>But that is stealing from the future. At the time of which I write,
                  Olga was just entering upon her long service, and I had yet to learn, by
                  contrasting her kindly behaviour with that of many another self-righteous mortal,
                  that so-called sins of the flesh are perhaps the least of evils. I, naturally, was
                  not much of a character analyst, but neither was I so stupid as not to perceive
                  that Laura’s mother, for example, managed to make herself and her daughter
                  thoroughly miserable, and her whole house a forbidding place to enter, although
                  she was doubtless free of the cardinal sins. Yes, and despite the fact that she
                  meant well, and really thought she was spending herself for the good of her
                  children. This thought, no less than the more arresting events I have been leading
                  up to, gave me many a fretful hour. For I had the tidy sort of old-maid mind that
                  wanted everything fitted into neat little pigeon-holes.</p>
               <p>The two happenings which now transpired in quick succession, to
                  give me still another slant on the peculiar workings of the human mind, have to do
                  with Stina, our dear old gossip. She and her Sam had a tiny cottage on the brow of
                  the hill, above our house, and, though the place was small, she had made room for
                  Big Tom. What is more, she surprised every one by having another baby. A little
                  girl, now nearly two years old, of whom she was immensely proud.</p>
               <p>Milde was a sweet little creature, with wide blue eyes, and the
                  kind of sunny hair that looks like wisps of summer cloud. It was more than
                  touching to see how tenderly the plain, hard-working mother waited upon this tiny
                  human being—the little flower of her old age, as she used to say. Marvellous were
                  the ambitions Stina had for the pretty child, and, of course, poor old Sam prized
                  her even above his sacred unions.</p>
               <p>Then, one Saturday morning, just as we were sipping the ten o’clock
                  coffee, in burst our neighbour, wild-eyed and distraught. Milde had taken sick!
                  But the sickness wasn’t natural, said Stina, sinking into a chair and staring at
                  mamma helplessly. She was sleeping now, the wee angel. But all night she had
                  tossed and cried out—sometimes gasping as though ghostly hands were tormenting
                  her, choking the breath out of her little body.</p>
               <p>‘My dear Stina! It may be a touch of the croup. Children are
                  subject to such things,’ mamma calmed her. ‘I’ll come at once, if you like, and
                  perhaps we should send for the doctor.’</p>
               <p>Stina started to cry. No, Milde was quite all right now. She
                  breathed easily, and had no fever, but, the fact remained, something evil hovered
                  over her. That Thing in the Night was a Visitation!</p>
               <p>‘Now, Stina, be sensible. Drink a bit of coffee and put such
                  notions out of your head. Very likely the child ate something that disagreed with
                  her.’</p>
               <p>Stina obediently drank her coffee, bolting it down like a bitter
                  medicine. Then she said: ‘It’s no use denying these things, Ingiborg. Isafell’s Mori’ (Ghost of the Mountain) ‘is after my child!’</p>
               <p>So there it was. Sam, it seems, was a member of a family afflicted
                  with a ghostly follower, a malignant creature who, in each generation, took
                  vengeance for an ancient wrong done him by a cruel employer. Nothing that mamma
                  found to say could in the least comfort Stina. She knew in her heart of hearts
                  that Milde was the chosen victim.</p>
               <p>To satisfy herself that the child was not seriously ill mamma
                  immediately set off for Stina’s house, and, so far as she could judge, the little
                  girl appeared quite normal. In the afternoon she was playing about as usual, and
                  so we thought no more about it. In fact, Stina and her ghost were the subjects of
                  affectionate derision that night at supper. It was all nonsense, said papa, but
                  added: nevertheless a lot of intelligent old-timers firmly believed in Isafell’s Mori.</p>
               <p>Whatever it was, we were sufficiently shocked next morning when
                  Sam, almost beside himself, tore into the house to tell us that little Milde was
                  dead. She had died at dawn, in the throes of some sort of violent convulsion, with
                  no other signs of sickness, and no warning of the attack.</p>
               <p>Poor Stina! There was little enough we could do for her, except to
                  share, with all our hearts, in her bitter grief. To listen, days on end, to the
                  pitiful tale, not even daring to dispute the justice of the sins of the fathers
                  being visited upon the children. But at last Stina comforted herself with the
                  thought that little Milde was safe in the heavenly country.</p>
               <p>‘Ja, maybe it’s best,’ she sighed. ‘My little love won’t break her
                  heart as women do in this world.’ After all, she herself was lucky to have Valdi,
                  who was such a good boy. Smart in school, and always so cheerful about delivering
                  the washing she did for the ladies in those fine city houses. A handsome boy,
                  Valdi, and never a nasty word out of him, thank God.</p>
               <p>There was another shock in store for our good neighbour. One day
                  Big Tom came home from work, and, for once he had something to say.</p>
               <p>‘It’s early, I know, Missus,’ said he, apologetically. ‘I ain’t
                  feeling so good—in here.’ And he tapped his broad chest.</p>
               <p>Stina left the washtub, and flew for the coffee-pot. ‘Man, dear,
                  you’re green about the gills! Now, Tom, don’t perch on that hard chair. Take the
                  rocker by the window. You’ll soon perk up with a nice hot drop. You hadn’t ought
                  to work so hard at your age.’</p>
               <p>Tom accepted the chair in silence, but when Stina brought the cup,
                  he made the first speech of his life:</p>
               <p>‘You’re a good woman—I—I—well, good!’</p>
               <p>Telling us this afterwards, Stina covered her face and wept. ‘Such
                  a look in his eyes, poor man. It made me ashamed, Mrs. Goodman—me, that was so
                  often so short, what with my sore feet and all.’</p>
               <p>His speech made, Tom had drunk his coffee, and, a little later,
                  went out in his silent, shadow way. Stina finished her washing, and began to make
                  supper, before she realized that her boarder had not come in again. He was not on
                  the porch, nor in the yard, where he sometimes did a bit of weeding. Then,
                  suddenly, she knew, and came rushing for papa.</p>
               <p>Big Tom, always the butt of malicious fate, had died in the
                  outhouse. To Stina, this was an almost insupportable misery. Ja, it taxed her
                  faith in Almighty God! It was so unseemly for a decent man to die in such a
                  place—as though it were meant as a final insult.</p>
               <p>Kind soul, she did her best to make amends, and nothing would do
                  but that her few acquaintances should honour the dead man by gathering round his
                  coffin in her small front room, before he was taken away. As might be expected,
                  these friends were humble women, none of whom could speak English very well. They
                  came in their Sunday best, their plain scrubbed faces eloquent of honest sympathy.
                  They had not known Big Tom, except as a plodding, inoffensive toiler, coming and
                  going upon his dull rounds. But they knew death, as all the poor know death. Their
                  solemnity was sincere, and their faith earnest.</p>
               <p>When they had sat in respectful silence for a woeful interlude, and
                  then suddenly realized that no pastor was present, that, in fact, no other rites
                  were to be held for Big Tom, one good old soul rose to the rescue. Tears streaming
                  from her faded eyes and her hands weaving nervously, she addressed the solemn
                  company.</p>
               <p>‘It’s not fitting to say nothing. What’s in the heart should come
                  out. Big Tom, now—God knows, we are sorry—Big Tom—ja, poor man—p-poor man——’ tears
                  choked her, and, with a heroic rush, she concluded: ‘He lived like a dog—and he
                  died like a dog. Lord Jesus receive him. Amen.’</p>
               <p>Thus, luckless to the last, Big Tom departed our ken.</p>
               <p>This same year mamma began to worry about my Christian education. I
                  use the term advisedly—my possible ignorance of the Scriptures, not any fear of
                  moral obliquity, troubled her. Mamma was a firm believer that decency was inbred,
                  not imbued. But she held firmly to the notion that respectable people should pass
                  their religious examinations like any other. That I knew the contents of the New
                  Testament almost by heart she was well aware. Papa had given me an English
                  Testament, which I still treasure, and which is marked from cover to cover. I was
                  to learn English by reading it, and read it I did, every night for many years.
                  Now, however, mamma wanted this reading to bear some tangible result. I must be
                  confirmed like every other child of decent, Episcopal Lutheran faith.</p>
               <p>But how to do it was a problem. There was no Icelandic church in
                  Duluth. The only solution was to attach myself to the Norwegian church which Tilly
                  attended.</p>
               <p>It seemed a timely thought. The church in question had called a new
                  minister, a young man full of zeal and fervent ambitions. The old church was to be
                  completely renovated, the basement enlarged, new pews installed, and a pipe organ
                  was to replace the rheumy instrument which in former days defeated every musical
                  effort. And to start the thing off right, the official opening of the reborn
                  church was to centre round the pastor’s first confirmation class. Well, you could
                  hardly ask for a more auspicious entrance into respectability. Still, if I were to
                  be thus favoured, I decided that Laura J. must share the good fortune. Laura’s
                  mamma naturally objected.</p>
               <p>Crazi ungi, how did she think Papa J. could find
                  a confirmation dress, and goodness knows what other nonsense? Crazi
                     ungi raised her voice for righteousness and rectitude, and won, with
                  breath to spare. So Laura, who understood as little of Norwegian as I, read the
                  English Catechism with me.</p>
               <p>The class was large, and we two were forced to sit through all the
                  tedious examinations of the others before our answers were required. The Reverend
                  Bjerke was a serious young man, determined that none of his sheep should go amiss.
                  In addition to the Catechism, the wider sanctities were impressed on us. The
                  Virtuous Life eschewed all frivolity, such as card-playing, drinking, dancing,
                  skating to music (for some reason incomprehensible to me, it was commendable in
                  the open, but not under a roof, where you were comfortable), the theatre, worldly
                  books, unseemly companions, immodest language, foolish mirth, and, above all, the
                  dangerous pitfalls of spurious religions.</p>
               <p>For the first time in my life I became intimately acquainted with
                  Satan, and all his works, and the sulphuric terrors of the yawning pit. It all had
                  a dreadful sound on the Pastor’s grim lips, and yet, to tell the truth none of us
                  lost an ounce of weight. As a matter of fact, we were all very fond of Pastor
                  Bjerke, for, despite his fierce recitals, he meant to be kind, and certainly his
                  earnestness was above question.</p>
               <p>He had married just before taking the charge, and as soon as his
                  wife was established in the modest manse, he celebrated by giving us a party. Dear
                  me, what a serious business it was! How impeccably modest and self-effacing was
                  the lady of his heart. Except to shake us by the hand and play the organ for a
                  brace of hymns, and to pour coffee in smiling shyness from a high silver pot, Mrs.
                  Bjerke discreetly kept the peace.</p>
               <p>This humility made me thoroughly uncomfortable, for the women of my
                  family were by no stretch of imagination gentle doves. They did not look to their
                  husbands for approval before they cracked a smile at the mildest joke, nor defer
                  the faintest opinion to their lordly sanction. Which was, I soon discovered, the
                  appointed ritual for young Mrs. Bjerke.</p>
               <p>No doubt this was good and beautiful, but, somehow it left me as
                  unconvinced as the precious prattle of Elsie Dinsmore. So, too, much of Reverend
                  Bjerke’s lusty thunder passed over me with small effect. His vitriolic blasts
                  against other forms of faith, for instance, only served to sharpen my critical
                  senses. I had spent three years in the Baptist Church, and, so far as I could see,
                  there was little difference between that hapless congregation and this little
                  flock. And if there were a difference it favoured the Baptists, whose hymns, at
                  least, were cheerful, and their minister a joy to the eye. Also, for a brief
                  while, I had attended Sunday school in the Presbyterian Church, of which my aunt
                  was a member, but fled in consternation when a lady tapped me on the shoulder,
                  and, in dripping piety, inquired if I were saved.</p>
               <p>I had been led to believe in the mercy of God, but not in the
                  practice of boasting of grace. Moreover, I knew quite well that mamma would have
                  been amused at the notion that an infant of thirteen had as yet anything to be
                  saved from, anything at all to brag about. However, these ventures furnished me
                  with courage to contend that other denominations were as concerned for the souls
                  of men as Our Saviour’s Lutheran Church.</p>
               <p>For the most part, Bjerke confined his barbs to the Catholic
                  heresy—for the Scarlet Woman who had set up her Abomination of Abominations in the
                  Holy of Holies. Idolaters! Deluded mortals, steeped in superstitions. A betrayed
                  people, who fixed their faith in signs and symbols: for example, the sign of the
                  cross.</p>
               <p>Well, at that, I pricked up my ears. Believe it or not, I still
                  crossed myself when I said my prayers, nor could I see why the moral effect of
                  such a practice was any more superstitious than setting up the cross on the altar
                  of the church itself. Moreover, when Bjerke waxed oratorical, painting the glories
                  of the church as the Bride of Christ, I was tempted to ask if he had not stolen a
                  leaf from the pages of Catholicism. To be truthful, I not infrequently plagued the
                  good man with outrageous contention, all of which he bore with patience although
                  he seldom permitted the little Norwegians to say a word. If any had wanted to say
                  a word!</p>
               <p>Perhaps the novelty of my impertinence amused him. Or mayhap he may
                  have realized that honesty, and no desire to be smart, was my defence. Or perhaps
                  it was simply that, as yet, he had not hardened into the unyielding jelly of
                  infallible bigotries.</p>
               <p>Be that as it may. Whatever good I derived from this experience, it
                  had nothing to do with Bjerke’s instructions. In all those months nothing except
                  questions of doctrine, and various chosen passages from the Scriptures, was
                  discussed. All of which stressed the moral of implicit obedience to a God who
                  thereupon smote your enemies, and made a jolly bonfire of the miserable upstarts
                  who questioned the rules of the game.</p>
               <p>This Germanic ideology might have appealed to me—it is so
                  tremendously flattering to imagine one’s self the chosen elect of an all-powerful
                  dictator—if I had not read the New Testament in the same spirit applied to any
                  other book. If I had not formed a picture of Jesus of Nazareth as a man above all
                  bigotry and hatred, a man clothed in the righteousness of a tolerant mind,
                  sensitive to beauty, compassionate of weakness; who loved the birds of the air,
                  and the lilies of the field; who spoke in parables, which is the language of
                  poetic hearts; and said of the Sinner: ‘Neither do I condemn thee.’ There it was,
                  simple and direct, a sword of truth, against which all this sectarian thunder must
                  surely die.</p>
               <p>For the moment, however, I was bound over to the dusty rituals, and
                  must acquit myself creditably in the pastor’s eyes. I must stand forth fully
                  equipped on confirmation day. And let no one imagine I had not my own earnest
                  desire to make something of this experience—a confession, not of religion, but of
                  an honest desire to respect the precepts of decency and justice.</p>
               <p>Pastor Bjerke did not spare us, bless his heart. With the
                  conscientious patience of an inquisitor, he plied his questions, gravely heard the
                  answers, and ponderously elaborated upon the meanings therein, and the seriousness
                  of the step we were taking. And there we stood, in our new-found finery, solemn
                  little owls, growing hungrier by the hour, and foolish with fatigue.</p>
               <p>My good aunt had come out for the occasion, dressed in her Sunday
                  satin, but, when, almost two hours had dragged by with no signs of weakening on
                  the pastor’s part, she picked up her reticule, and, indignation in every rustle,
                  stalked away, nothing caring how many saints she shocked.</p>
               <p>Greeting me later over the celebration dinner mamma had prepared,
                  she said: ‘My dear child, does the man go on like that all the time? Assaulting
                  thought with Biblical brickbats? Heavens above! Well—well—did you like the muff I
                  gave you?’</p>
               <p>Certainly I liked the muff. Liked all the new regalia, which, I
                  fondly hoped, gave me a very smart appearance. The cashmere dress, with its
                  overlace yoke and shirring, was nothing to sneeze at, believe me. A competent
                  dressmaker had made it, and proudly declared that the puffed sleeves were copied
                  from the dress of a society queen. I had a new coat, too, of slate grey, form
                  fitting, which added years to my innocence. Indeed, I could almost believe my
                  hated plumpness was easing up a bit. My face would never launch a thousand ships,
                  or even a single frigate, but the rest of me wasn’t so bad. An opinion which seems
                  to have seized upon the fancy of a very nice young man in the congregation, for, a
                  couple of Sundays later, he very properly saw me home.</p>
               <p>Goodness me, that was a twittering occasion. Nor was he to be got
                  rid of so easily as Simon. He was not argumentative, which was a terrible
                  handicap, and he loved books, which made it impossible not to be interested in his
                  conversation. Moreover, it was very flattering to be asked to the next basket
                  social.</p>
               <p>But the fly in the ointment was my passion for another fascinating
                  creature, a beautiful thing called Manfred, whom I worshipped from afar, had never
                  spoken to, and should very likely have died of ecstasy had he so much as glanced
                  my way. And there was still another complication. Never mean with my affection, I
                  had a really soft spot in my heart for Arne, one of the boys in the confirmation
                  class. All through that fall Arne had steered me safely past the terrors of the
                  homeward path. It was difficult, to say the least. Tilly thought it very romantic,
                  for Carl was quite the best catch in the church. She said she and no end of girls
                  were angling for him. Even Mrs. Bjerke’s niece had her eyes on him. If I had any
                  sense, I’d nab the poor dear before he changed his mind.</p>
               <p>This excellent advice had a startling inference. ‘But, Tilly,’ I
                  yelped, ‘I don’t want to nab him. I don’t want to nab anybody. I’m going to school
                  for years and years and years.’</p>
               <p>‘Just the same, I’d hang on to him,’ she retorted, with admirable
                  logic. ‘To make safe. You’ll never find any one nicer.’</p>
               <p>We had reached that certain age, it seemed. A delightfully silly
                  age, where, for a brief interval, we played with emotion, walking in rosy light,
                  and forgot reality. It was all very harmless and innocent—a statement which will
                  be suspected in this day of Freudian preoccupation—nevertheless, true. I shall
                  come to more serious attachments, but, at this time, our romantic attachments
                  never exceeded the charming business of holding hands at a sleigh ride, or on the
                  doorstep under the stars, and, strange though it may seem, it was very, very
                  thrilling.</p>
               <p>To be sure, I had enough to keep me occupied in school and at home.
                  I was still subject to bouts of bronchitis and everlasting migraine headaches.
                  There was scarcely a week when the latter did not steal a day or two from my
                  classes, and I had therefore to work the harder when my senses cleared. Then, too
                  I read an unconscionable lot, made all my own clothes, helped with the children’s
                  clothes, did the marketing, and not infrequently the Sunday baking. Carl, and the
                  odd social, were the least of my concerns.</p>
               <p>What did intrigue me, far above any flutter of romance, were the
                  pathetic cases that drifted to my aunt’s hospital. From all over the State, and
                  sometimes from Ontario, these girls and women came to be eased of their unwelcome
                  burden, and to hide from society. That so many strange human histories unfolded
                  before me was not due to any persuasion on my part. I popped along to the
                  hospital, and aunt, perhaps looking up from some bit of reading, would push up her
                  spectacles, eye me soberly, and say:</p>
               <p>‘So there you are! Well, run up to number eight. There’s a poor
                  creature needs cheering. But, mind you, take no stock of what she says. They’re
                  apt to lie, poor souls.’</p>
               <p>Up I’d go to number eight, or ten, or two, or whatever it was. Not
                  much wanting to be a perambulating confessional, but nobody, in his right senses,
                  crossed my aunt lightly. At first I nearly perished of fright, as I entered these
                  little cubicles, so overcast with tangled emotions. For always, the feel of a room communicates a great deal to me, and the vibrations of
                  spiritual anguish are a terrible force. After a bit, however, my very shyness and
                  stupidity inspired confidence—as though each of those unhappy Magdalenes said to
                  herself: there’s no harm in telling my troubles to this idiot, no more harm than
                  talking to the clothes-press.</p>

               <head>Tales out of Time</head>
               <p>It is not my intention to run through the whole, colourful
                  catalogue, but I hope I may be pardoned for retelling two or three of these
                  stories: the two or three that really exceed fiction in melodrama, needless
                  tragedy, and twisted humour.</p>
               <p>There was Bessie, who, for several weeks after her baby was born
                  gave me music lessons, because my aunt thought it would settle her mind, and that
                  I might as well benefit by the healing process. Bessie came from Port Arthur. She
                  was a fragile, soft-spoken young woman, with fair hair and the wide blue eyes
                  which are supposed to be so appealing to men. She had a fairly good education, and
                  was an excellent musician. Her people were the sort we usually call the salt of
                  the earth. Decent, respectable, hard-working people. Bessie’s story reads like
                  something out of Dickens at his most lacrimal inventiveness, yet it was impossible
                  to doubt her.</p>
               <p>Bessie was the only daughter in a family of several sons. Her
                  father worshipped her, and her brothers, who had paid for her musical instruction,
                  were immensely proud of her. Yet it was they who unwittingly paved the way for her
                  tragic experience.</p>
               <p>One day they brought home a mining engineer, a young fellow to whom
                  they had taken a fancy, and who wanted lodgings in some decent house. He came on a
                  visit, and remained over a year. That he should have repaid the kindly regard of
                  the family, and Bessie’s affection, as he did, is nothing new in human affairs,
                  but the way he made his escape deserves mention.</p>
               <p>Employed as he was, it was not unusual for him to be away for
                  several weeks at a time. After one such absence, Bessie, in fear and trembling,
                  confessed her predicament. But of course there was nothing for her to fear!
                  Certainly not. Was he not her lover?</p>
               <p>How ashamed she was, to have doubted him! How she wept in his
                  comforting arms! Once again, all was well with the world. Even when, a few days
                  later, he left again, she accepted his smiling reassurance in perfect faith. He
                  had a job to finish, but when that was done they’d be married, and go away
                  somewhere. Twice he repeated his flying visit, each time augmenting the golden
                  promises. Then, silence.</p>
               <p>Weeks of silence, while fear turned her blood to ice, and every
                  night to sleepless misery. What was she to do? To whom could she turn? To her
                  brothers, who were so proud of her? To her father, in whose eyes she was still a
                  little child? To her mother, who would suffer the most, believing that she had
                  failed in maternal guidance? Night after night Bessie struggled with her terror,
                  not quite believing the dark intuition of her heart.</p>
               <p>Then, one morning, she stole up to her lover’s room, where some of
                  his clothes still hung in the closet, and his trunk stood under the north wall.
                  With rising alarm, she thought, perhaps the trunk was empty? For a glance told her
                  that the clothes in the press were discards. No, the trunk was not empty. When she
                  shoved it, in sudden anger, it didn’t budge.</p>
               <p>‘And that’, sobbed poor Bessie, ‘was what frightened me out of my
                  wits. It was too heavy! Even before I pried the lock, I seemed to know what was in
                  it. Oh God, I don’t know how he could do it. I don’t. I really don’t——’ And then
                  she fixed me with her wide child’s eyes swimming in tears. ‘The tray was full of
                  stones! Stones, from the fields where he made love to me.’</p>
               <p>So now those flying trips were explained: trips to remove his
                  valuables, without arousing suspicion. The rest of the tale came out in broken
                  phrases, both of us frankly crying. There was nothing now to be done except to
                  tell her mother, and the mother, of course, had to inform the father. Poor Bessie
                  could hardly go on from there. Her father had been so crushed, so utterly broken,
                  and then had flown into such a towering rage.</p>
               <p>He would set the law on the scoundrel! He would have him tarred and
                  feathered! Oh, any number of mad threats fumed on his lips. But, in the end, the
                  poor parents knew that none of this would benefit their daughter. What they did
                  decide upon, was to send Bessie away, before her brothers discovered the truth.
                  And here she was, presumably visiting a relative. When the baby was born, a good
                  home was to be found for it, and she herself would return to pick up the broken
                  pattern of her life. Oh, yes, she was sure that that was best. That nothing else
                  was possible under the circumstances.</p>
               <p>What she failed to consider, what they all had failed to consider,
                  was Bessie’s unspoiled, normal instincts. The moment the baby was born, she
                  refused to be parted from it. The very thought made her clutch it to her breast in
                  wildest agitation. She refused to give it up. Rather than part with it, she would
                  never go home, but somehow would fend for herself where she was.</p>
               <p>My aunt wired for the mother, not to dissuade Bessie from a natural
                  course, but to give them the opportunity to hatch a fresh scheme. And, pathetic
                  enough it was. Bessie’s mother was to pretend she had adopted the child of a
                  relative, who had just died in Wisconsin, and Bessie herself was not to come home
                  for several weeks. (Since becoming acquainted with her home town, I’ve often
                  wondered if anybody was fooled.)</p>
               <p>Well, that was better than nothing. The baby would be hers to love.
                  ‘Oh, my sweet!’ she wept, hugging the little creature. ‘I can’t ever be your
                  mummy—but I’ll love you—love you.’</p>
               <p>The baby had to be weaned, and that night Bessie cried herself
                  sick. It was after this that my aunt decided she should give me music lessons. To
                  take her mind off the child. But the baby had only to send up a thread of sound,
                  and away Bessie flew, nothing caring how I murdered the scales. How vividly her
                  memory lingers. How often have I longed to know the end of the story.</p>
               <p>Then there was Catherine, whose story not only touched me at this
                  time, but was to unfold yet another chapter some years later. It is not an easy
                  tale to tell, for the rock on which Cathy’s happiness grounded was religious
                  prejudice, always a touchy subject. And I should like it understood that my
                  rambles amongst people of all shades of faith have convinced me that the score of
                  kindly people is the same in all of them. That the thoroughly unreasonable person
                  is so, not because of his faith, but by nature.</p>
               <p>Cathy’s father, a prosperous business-man, was the sort of
                  household tyrant we have come to associate with the Victorian age—a paragon, with
                  no lovable weaknesses. The kind of man who neither smokes, nor drinks, nor lets
                  himself believe that he ever cast a lingering—not to say lascivious—glance at a
                  pretty ankle. He was a pillar in the Presbyterian Church, blessed his bread before
                  eating, and, quite naturally, expected his wife and daughter to render thanks to
                  Almighty God for such a flawless husband and father.</p>
               <p>He was liberal with money, and maintained a good home. In other
                  words, he had all the easy virtues, but not an ounce of actual charity, not even a
                  glimmer of spiritual grace. Everything he did was right, and whatever he believed
                  was beyond a single point of difference. His church was his God.</p>
               <p>Until Cathy met Jim no occasion had ever risen to threaten the sway
                  of that Presbyterian authority. Jim was a Catholic, and Jim had the audacity to
                  love Cathy with a most unreasonable tenacity. But what really threw papa into
                  violent fits was the discovery that his own child, his flesh and blood, his
                  pretty, carefully reared Cathy, returned this outrageous affection. There were
                  tears and battles, and more tears and battles. Cathy’s mamma, the meek sort of
                  woman such men always choose with unerring good sense, tried a little mild
                  argument.</p>
               <p>Jim was such a nice boy. Indeed, there was nothing the least wrong
                  with him, except his religion. And, after all, was he responsible for the
                  delusions of his parents? Well, what of it? roared papa. If a man had small-pox,
                  he was not responsible, yet one did not endanger life by contact with him. Was
                  Cathy, the apple of his eye to risk even worse infection? No more arguments, please! Not a word!</p>
               <p>Love is no respecter of religions. Cathy simply flew to Jim in
                  secret, and the hopelessness of their case increased their need of each other.
                  That they reacted unwisely is no reflection upon their innate decency. They were
                  both very young, very much tormented by a multiplicity of emotions. For Jim was
                  just as judiciously steeped in his particular brand of loyalty as Cathy. He was a
                  devout Catholic, and his sisters, much older than he, were equally devout, but, as
                  the final sequel will demonstrate, had also a sense of duty that Cathy’s father
                  could not have exercised.</p>
               <p>It was a thoroughly miserable mess. The kind of mess good people
                  provoke and doubtless will continue to provoke so long as their goodness is
                  tangled in sectarian creeds. When the inevitable consequences of all this useless
                  struggle had to be faced, Jim very sensibly decided that they should be married at
                  once. Cathy confided in her mother, and then the real battle began.</p>
               <p>It was impossible! Quite impossible, moaned the thoroughly
                  frightened mother. Papa would never survive such a shock. Only last year they had
                  lost their elder daughter, and all papa’s affection centred in Cathy. It would
                  kill him if she married against his will—and, moreover, how could she think that
                  this—this other horrible thing, wouldn’t be just as insupportable, even though
                  they did marry?</p>
               <p>I must confess that, if Cathy’s mother had not herself repeated
                  this part of the tale in an agony of grief and self-reproach, I might have come to
                  doubt it. For, quite frankly, I have never been able to understand this, how human
                  beings can believe that God, the Spirit of Life, can possibly be served by the
                  destruction of his creatures. But the mother so worked upon Cathy that she
                  consented to be sent away. They told the father she had an offer of a secretarial
                  job in Duluth. So, here she was, in one of my aunt’s little rooms, eating out her
                  heart and whiling away the endless hours writing to Jim, and, of course, to papa,
                  who had to be told how the job progressed. Jim paid her expenses. That’s another
                  thing I’ve noticed about piety. It seldom quarrels with the sources of money.</p>
               <p>Cathy was a handsome, robust-looking girl, but appearances are
                  seemingly deceptive. In the sixth month she began to develop serious symptoms.
                  Aunt called in a specialist, who diagnosed her trouble. Diseased kidney, said he,
                  which was the worst possible report under the circumstances.</p>
               <p>Aunt at once decided that Cathy should be taken to the general
                  hospital, where she would receive the necessary supervision and treatment. But, in
                  spite of every care, she grew steadily worse, and before the month was up her
                  condition was so critical that my aunt, who was still the go-between, sent for the
                  mother and notified Jim he might expect a wire any moment.</p>
               <p>A few days later Cathy died, giving premature birth to twins. Now,
                  thought my aunt, indignantly, the wretched father will realize the enormity of his
                  wrongheadedness. The poor young things might just as well have had a happy year or
                  two. But, she was wrong. Overwhelmed though she was with her own loss, Cathy’s
                  mother thought first and foremost of papa. Never, never, must he discover the
                  circumstances of his daughter’s death. It would kill him. He felt so intensely,
                  and his heart was so bad. Cathy’s death he could accept, as an act of God—but
                  not—not the image of Cathy as the mother of illegitimate children! Utterly
                  disgusted, aunt let her weep. Weep and pray.</p>
               <p>The practical details she attended to herself, helped to some
                  extent by Jim, who bore the brunt of all the expenses, though so numbed by grief
                  it was pitiful to see.</p>
               <p>The end of it was that Cathy returned home in solemn state, to be
                  buried from the Presbyterian Church, and the little scraps of humanity were taken
                  over by my aunt. What a fight she made to save them! Tiny, blue, under-developed,
                  they had no more gotten a lease on life than they developed a severe cold that
                  every minute threatened to cut off breathing.</p>
               <p>Night and day, she watched them, in the end applying artificial
                  respiration, and I don’t know what else. Futile, said the doctor, utterly futile!
                  But one of the children survived, and grew to be a pretty little girl for whom my
                  aunt formed so deep an attachment she wanted to adopt her.</p>
               <p>But that was not to be. And here I must borrow from the future to
                  end the tale. Jim, who obviously could do nothing about the baby without casting
                  reflection upon the memory of Cathy, compromised with his conscience by sending
                  the odd donation for little Ruby’s maintenance. Of course, my aunt acknowledged
                  these gifts by reporting the child’s progress. Now, as fate would have it, Jim had
                  received such a letter from her just as he was leaving on a visit to his elderly
                  maiden sisters, who lived in Seattle. As spinsters will, the sisters decided to
                  renovate their brother’s wardrobe while he was with them, and, in emptying the
                  pockets of a coat, before sending it to the cleaner, they came upon a letter with
                  a mystifying return address: ‘Haldor Olson, Midwife, Private Hospital, Duluth,
                  Minn.’</p>
               <p>What on earth could Jim be doing with such a letter? The temptation
                  was too much for them, they opened the letter, and discovered Ruby. What their
                  reactions were, or what sort of struggle ensued, I cannot, of course, say. But
                  what their final decision was, I know only too well, for by the time all this took
                  place I was living with my aunt and doing her correspondence. The sisters wrote
                  that it was clearly their duty to give the child a happy, proper home.</p>
               <p>‘Now I like that!’ cried my aunt. ‘A couple of old maids understand
                  the needs of an infant better than I! Especially a baby like Ruby, whose emotions
                  are bound to be unstable. Tell the good women all I want from them is permission
                  to adopt the child.’</p>
               <p>Letters flew back and forth. But again the vexatious question of
                  faith popped up. The aunts refused to relinquish the child they had never seen,
                  and could not possibly love, because my aunt, who thought the world of Ruby, was a
                  Protestant. No, they could not think of it. They were setting forth at once, to
                  fetch their little niece. It was a matter of conscience, of Christian duty,
                  against which the lesser claims of materialism were of no avail.</p>
               <p>‘Religion!’ snorted my aunt. ‘The stupid women! Well—no doubt they
                  meant to be kind. Oh, my poor little Ruby!’</p>
               <p>But now to go back. Fortunately, these cases had not always a
                  purely tragic flavour. For instance, a tall dazed-looking individual presented
                  herself at the hospital one wintry day. She wasn’t so well, she said. She had a
                  tumour, she thought, some kind of swelling, anyway, that gave her a misery. So?
                  Well, there were other hospitals for such ailments, explained my aunt, as
                  seriously as she could. Oh, sure, but Jenny had taken a fancy to come here. A bit
                  of rest might be all she required. To get off her feet, and be quiet.</p>
               <p>Then she started to cry, in a soundless way. ‘Now, now! That won’t
                  do!’ boomed my aunt. ‘I expect I can handle that tumour, all right.’</p>
               <p>The tumour, in due course, made its appearance as an eight-pound
                  boy. Even then, Jenny clung to her defences. It was most astonishing. It was that.
                  She really couldn’t understand it—unless it was that the son of the house slipped
                  up the back stairs, one night.</p>
               <p>‘Well,’ chuckled my aunt, ‘the thing to do now, is to let the son
                  of the house slip down to a lawyer’s office, and sign a cheque for the tumour’s
                  maintenance.’</p>

               <p>To return to more relevant matters. My young friends, no less than
                  I, had reached a point where the impressions crowding upon us so swiftly made a
                  sort of crazy-quilt of our thoughts, each patch of experience highly coloured and
                  distinct, but without sequence or tangible design. The only thing any one of us
                  was clear about was our dissatisfaction with the cramping circumstances of our
                  lives. Laura was thoroughly the rebel. She hated gloom and growling and the
                  unrelieved dreariness of her home. At the first possible opportunity she meant to
                  get away—it didn’t matter where, or how she managed it. Anything would be better
                  than that endless round of stupid chores and bitter complaints. Tilly seldom
                  expressed any violent opinions, yet she, too, dreamed of something better than the
                  dull service to which she was enslaved. Not with envy, but a sort of bated
                  admiration, she sometimes spoke of the carefree existence girls like Mollie
                  MacDonald took for granted.</p>
               <p>As for myself, although I ranted freely enough about things I
                  disliked, I was secretive with my dearest ambition. Ever since that day in the
                  ugly old library, my dream had never wavered. I wanted to write. Goodness knows
                  how many arithmetic lessons I had flunked because the fever to scribble something
                  refused to be denied. Reams of verse, principally in the Bryant strain: mournful
                  requiems to the weather, the woods, the timeless stream, and what-not. About which
                  beautiful silliness I was secretive as the grave.</p>
               <p>And secretive I remained about anything I really prized. Although I
                  have ridden many hobby horses, I never had the courage to hie me forth like Lady
                  Godiva, stripped to the skin. If one must make a spectacle, it might as well be in
                  plumage of sorts. After all, very few people, I soon discovered, care a fig about
                  the natural complexion of your hide, or what you believe or hunger after for your
                  innermost heart’s desire. Every one was equally preoccupied with his own crying
                  want, which made it ridiculous to expect passionate concern for something which to
                  him seemed a remote and alien abstraction. Even your own family seldom showed much
                  sympathy for the quirks of temperament which set you apart. And since it was my
                  misfortune to be over-serious and ridiculously sensitive about the things I deeply
                  prized, I kept them to myself.</p>
               <p>For instance, like most Icelanders, I was a confirmed bookworm, and
                  what is even worse, had a natural taste for stuff that either horrified or bored
                  my friends to death. What in the world made me want to weep over yarns like The Necklace, and work myself into a frenzy over the horrors of
                  the Inquisition, they couldn’t imagine. It was crazy! Things that had happened
                  ages and ages ago didn’t matter now! What did matter were pretty clothes, and a
                  boy friend to take you places. Certainly, I agreed about the clothes. I should
                  have liked nothing better than to slink about arrayed like Anna Held and Lilian
                  Russell. But you couldn’t get wearing apparel at the public library.</p>
               <p>This all-important question did begin to worry me. Perhaps I
                  thought that Carl might tire of trotting me about in my confirmation dress. At any
                  rate, when I chanced upon an advertisement by the Mack-Leon
                     Players, for extras, I borrowed a dime from mamma and took the car uptown.
                  The mere sight of the old Lyceum Theatre sent me into a dither. I’m sure I circled
                  the block ten times before I had the courage to creep into the dark passage beyond
                  the stage door. Pitch-black and empty, the tunnel seemed, and beyond it an equally
                  black, yawning space.</p>
               <p>No one was in sight, but just as I was screwing up courage to
                  explore this strange pit, a gay laugh sounded from somewhere.</p>
               <p>‘You do look a ghost! Come on in—it’s a grand place for spooks!’ a
                  voice informed me.</p>
               <p>Then I saw her, sitting on a keg, under a mountain of scenery. My
                  eyes, adjusted to the gloom, I could see that she was young, though not such a
                  chit as I, that she had a merry face, and curly, blonde hair. ‘I’m Hedda,’ she
                  went on. ‘Just another stage-struck nanny. Where does it hurt most? Comedy or
                  Tragedy?’</p>
               <p>That was the start of a friendship and an interlude of pleasant
                  excitement that was the happiest period of my life. Hedda was a graduate of a
                  Chicago school of drama and oratory. What its specific name was, I forget, for it
                  seemed of little consequence. Hedda herself was such a remarkable discovery. I had
                  never before met any one whose entire heart was bound up in these arts.</p>
               <p>She had real ability, and was wonderful at characterization, which
                  was what she longed to do, and for which she had a perfect voice, flexible,
                  sympathetic, and beautifully modulated. I think, too, she realized she had not the
                  slightest sense of dress, and could never in the world represent a dear young
                  thing in fluffs and billows, although she was shapely and good-looking. This may
                  seem a curious criticism for me to make, whose knowledge of such glories was
                  solely derived from the buxom beauties on cigar boxes. Still, it does not
                  necessarily follow that, because you have no money to invest in fine feathers,
                  that you cannot wear such trappings with a certain dash if they are provided.</p>
               <p>In the months to come both Hedda and I had many an opportunity to
                  strut in borrowed plumage, and the first and dearest compliment I ever received
                  from Miss Leon was upon my management of an Elizabethan court dress. In
                  farthingale and train and elaborate coiffure, Hedda made anything but a stately
                  appearance. She looked so robustly dowdy that nothing but an elderly make-up saved
                  her from outright comedy. I doubt that Svengali could have given her grace to
                  walk.</p>
               <p>However, these limitations were an asset to the kind of roles she
                  coveted. Any kind of old harridan, any dialect, any mood, from the most tragic to
                  the utterly ridiculous, was her dear delight. That Hedda gave up a predestined
                  career is one of the many unsung sacrifices to which countless women give
                  themselves for the so-called good of selfish relatives. But that was still far in
                  the future.</p>
               <p>At this time Hedda was in constant demand as a public entertainer,
                  and because she was waiting for a chance to slip into the legitimate theatre she
                  was on call for small parts. Thanks to her liking for me, I had the same chance,
                  and, what was even more gratifying, she managed to teach me something about voice,
                  and the necessity to create from within any characterization.</p>
               <p>During the school holidays I spent many precious hours with Hedda,
                  poring over all sorts of oratorical stuff. Most of it was cheaply melodramatic
                  for, that, said Hedda, was the best possible medium to give one emotional control.
                  But we read good poetry as well; charming lyrics, for music; Bobby Burns, for
                  tenderness; and, of course, Shakespeare, who is every actor’s last word and
                  testament. These readings, over which we had the greatest fun imaginable, with
                  Hedda performing in a dozen voices, and the two of us often reduced to tears, or
                  uncontrollable laughter, were, I think, the true incentive for the course I mapped
                  out for myself some time later, when my own dream of a classical education turned
                  to ashes.</p>
               <p>Deprived of so much, I none the less made up my mind to form the
                  habit of constructive reading, of setting myself subjects to cover in honest
                  fashion: history, philosophy, art—of these one need not remain ignorant in this
                  day and age, no matter what the state of the purse. Yet, perhaps I might have
                  failed even here if I had not, by great good fortune, found an elderly, retired
                  schoolmistress who sometimes did a bit of coaching. I wish I had the power to
                  depict this gentle soul, as I remember her in my heart of hearts. Her whole life
                  had been one unselfish service to the kind of mother who sits like a spider in the
                  centre of the family web, devouring, one after the other, the vital years of her
                  progeny.</p>
               <p>Consequently, Miss Rudd looked exactly what she was: a little lost
                  lady, who fed her emotions vicariously. No doubt she was a capable teacher in her
                  generation, but even in my comparatively unsophisticated youth her romantic
                  susceptibilities seemed faintly foolish, and I shudder to think how dangerously
                  decadent she would have found the smart young things of the post-war
                  generation.</p>
               <p>She had a most amusing way of darting off on remote tangents,
                  caught up on some far-winged thought to which she had drifted while her supposed
                  students plodded through laborious passages.</p>
               <p>For example, reading Richard the Third: King
                  Edward replying to Stanley, pleading the boon of his servant’s life:</p>
              
               <p>Have I a tongue to doom my brother’s death,</p>
               <p>And shall that tongue give pardon to a slave?</p>
               <p>My brother killed no man, his fault was
                  thought:</p>
               <p>And yet his punishment was bitter death.</p>
               <p>Who sued to me for him? who, in my wrath,</p>
               <p>Kneeled at my feet, and bid me be advised?</p>
               <p>Who spoke of brotherhood? Who spoke of love?</p>
               <p>Miss Rudd, dreamily: ‘Ah, human passion! Poor, distraught, human
                  passion. So many hearts rent with bitter, bitter regret. Everywhere. Yes,
                  everywhere. Even among the most tender lovers—do you remember that precious lyric
                  in The Princess?</p>
               <!-- rend=';' -->
               <p>As through the land at eve we went</p>
               <p>  And plucked the ripened ears,</p>
               <p>We fell out, my wife and I,</p>
               <p>  We fell out, I know not why,</p>
               <p>  And kissed again with tears.</p>
               <p rend="noindent"> </p>
               <p>For when we came where lies the child</p>
               <p>  We lost in other years,</p>
               <p>There above the little grave</p>
               <p>  Oh, there above the little grave</p>
               <p>  We kissed again with tears.</p>
               <p>‘Go on—go on: “Who told me how the poor soul did forsake——“ ’</p>
               <p>Not the most scientific treatment of Shakespeare, I dare say, but a
                  pleasing introduction to the tender vagaries of the mind. Since that far day I
                  have been privileged to listen to many erudite mouthings, and to worry through
                  much admirably compiled material, yet none of it inspired a more earnest desire to
                  rightly appreciate the riches of letters than those winsome, vagabond asides. For
                  I came to see an underlying unity of purpose in those queer flights and
                  turnings.</p>
               <p>Time! Time! She had so little left of time. And in those kind,
                  faded eyes that smiled on me so mistily, I seemed a likely subject for what she
                  found most worthy in a sadly harassed world. Her goodness gave me attributes
                  beyond desert, motives beyond fulfilling. If only I could have told her how dearly
                  I treasured her foolish faith in me! Youth is not given to honest speeches. If
                  only she could have known how often in the days to come that cherished faith drew
                  out of the dark a solitary star which refused to doff its light.</p>
               <p>But Hedda waits, in the dressing-room of the old theatre. It is a
                  night I recall with especial vividness, because of a bit of comedy that took place
                  in the wings. Or such it seems now, although at that time none of us, extras or
                  company, saw much humour in it.</p>
               <p>Willard Mack was a man of tremendous energy, and somewhat
                  overbearing enthusiasm. Whatever the company undertook, he required that every
                  detail should be as perfect as their combined talents and properties permitted. He
                  demanded unreserved co-operation, and expected implicit obedience. He detested any
                  signs of levity off the stage when a serious play was progressing. As a rule, even
                  the extras were properly solemn, and sufficiently impressed by the subject under
                  way not to crack a smile, much less to laugh.</p>
               <p>But this night, the unforgivable occurred. Some one laughed, and
                  that some one no irrepressible youngster, but our grave and stately heavy. And at
                  the ill-starred moment of an impassioned speech by Willard, down stage near the
                  wings. The last word uttered, out the gentleman catapulted, thunder on his brow,
                  lightning in his eye.</p>
               <p>‘Laugh! Damn you, laugh!’ the outraged artist roared, his fist
                  crashing into the handsomest face in the company.</p>
               <p>What now? Our pounding pulses throbbed. Would our handsome villain,
                  measuring his elegant length on the dusty floor, react as actor, or mere man?
                  Would the play go on, or a backstage brawl make history?</p>
               <p>The play went on. With the same inscrutable composure that he faced
                  death and damnation with in a dozen plays, the gentleman picked himself up,
                  brushed his dishonoured trousers, and, without a word, sauntered up to his
                  dressing-room to calcimine his eye. Which was the end of the incident, except for
                  a lingering, purple bruise, and an increased quiet in the wings.</p>
               <p>I should not want to give the impression that Mr. Mack was an
                  irascible tyrant. Forceful, volatile, brilliant, he was impatient of perfection,
                  but not at all a fearsome individual. A splendid actor, with a really fine voice,
                  he possessed to a marked degree those qualities of interpretive invention which
                  were to make him famous as a playwright—famous far beyond the dreams of the
                  thousands who revelled in the productions of the old Mack-Leon Stock Company.</p>
               <p>Miss Leon was not fated to create the same stir in the world, but
                  there must be many a sober middle-aged woman in the range towns and Duluth who
                  remember with sentimental fondness the beautiful roles she created for their
                  youthful enjoyment; roles as divergent as Sappho, and simple trusting Gloria;
                  remember, too, her vivid beauty and sympathetic voice.</p>
               <p>Less important members measured up to the best traditions of the
                  stage. There was an ingénue who grimly finished the week,
                  though she was coming down with a serious illness that required an operation; and
                  her successor, a slip of a thing who took the boards on the following Monday, with
                  less than twenty-four hours’ preparation.</p>
               <p>I worshipped them all for the enthusiasm they radiated, the zest
                  they had for life. They were the first group of people I had ever seen actively
                  engaged in the pursuit of happiness. Whatever their individual difficulties,
                  faults, and failings, they really lived. Even our stage-manager had a redeeming
                  sparkle, although his morals were a bit blotchy. He had a fondness for the bottle
                  and buxom wenches. Yet, he it was kept a fatherly eye upon Hedda and myself, and,
                  on one occasion, fired a young chap whom he thought too fresh. No saint, but a
                  fierce old watch-dog when the need arose. Nor was our romantic lead a
                  Sunday-school hero—which was not surprising, considering the horde of temptresses
                  that hung about the stage door.</p>
               <p>I loved it all. The miraculous transformations, the dark clutter of
                  jumbled scenery translated into romantic splendour: gay gardens, devoted to lovers
                  murmuring of immortal devotion; pillared palaces, where strutted lords and ladies,
                  glamorous and brave; classic heaths, where the grand cadences of Shakespeare wrung
                  the heart. I loved the yawning black of the empty house at rehearsal, a fretful,
                  dark expectancy that hung upon each nervous word like a creative challenge. I
                  loved the musty smells, the swift irritabilities, the lightning moods, the hustle
                  and haste and eternal anxieties; everything, from the reek of grease paint to the
                  rosy arch of the footlights. It was a world in which to lose the mean and the
                  commonplace, a world of noble sentiment, where the written word was clothed with
                  living power.</p>
               <p>There it was. That was the source of my worship. The theatre
                  revealed, as nothing else ever had, the force and beauty and persuasion of words.
                  That was why I was happy to warm myself at this magic fire, yet never thought of
                  the profession as a possible vocation. Words I meant to acquire, but that I now
                  possessed any marketable attribute had never dawned on me.</p>
               <p>Small wonder I could scarcely believe my ears when, one night, the
                  stage-manager rushed in to say that I could sell my legs. My legs? My legs?</p>
               <p>‘Yes, yes, your legs, you fool! Don’t you know you have a perfect
                  pair of legs?’ he roared. ‘What’s wrong with you? Here—let me show you! There you
                  are! There you are! That’s something, let me tell you,’ said he, beaming down upon
                  my startled knees.</p>
               <p>Yes, and there was I, staring idiotically at familiar, yet utterly
                  strange extremities, for which it appeared I could collect real money from a
                  vaudeville house down the street. How they laughed at me, standing there clutching
                  my skirts and eyeing suspiciously the objects under discussion. Legs, it seemed,
                  were not always just fatted bones to cart one about. Perish the thought! There
                  were as many kinds of legs, and to as many themes conjoined, as bungled sonnets.
                  Legs that filled the really sensitive artists with fretful despair: too long, too
                  short, too flabby, too muscular; yes, even shapely legs that rudely leapt from
                  rough knees, utterly blasting the poetic promise. To put it bluntly, most of the
                  beauties prancing the boards had to wear ‘hearts’ to hide the nasty little hollows
                  that ruined otherwise perfect showpieces!</p>
               <p>From such a sour calamity fate had saved me. Just think of it, I
                  was neither knock-kneed, bow-legged, nor afflicted with those curious blemishes
                  that give nightmares to the sensitive connoisseur of female legs. It seemed that I
                  could click my ankles and knees together without inviting mirth. Hence this
                  remarkable offer from down the street. My would-be benefactor, who had caught
                  sight of these rarities in a rough-and-tumble mob scene, was instantly filled with
                  the milk of human kindness. No matter what sort of face went with the legs, he
                  would overlook it.</p>
               <p>Here was my chance, said the stage-manager—and let me not imagine
                  I’d get any other. If I had an ounce of sense, I’d thank my stars and grab it.
                  Dear me, how lightly promises flourish, and how uselessly. Even with the best of
                  sense, to which I lay no claim, there was still mamma to be reckoned with. Mamma,
                  and the ancestors. The mere thought of persuading the daughter of a long line of
                  dignified clerics that her child should gambol about in pink tights for the
                  entertainment of dispirited business men, put me in a perfect funk. Gracious
                  goodness, if that was my one hope of immortality I might as well resign myself to
                  a nameless grave.</p>
               <p>Hedda reasoned with me. So did the benevolent gentleman. If my
                  conscience was so tender, I could wear a mask! The implication, not exactly
                  flattering, ruffled my temper. Then and there, so to speak, I committed myself to
                  rectitude, and a plain face. Thirty dollars a week was a fortune to be sure, but
                  in that day I had not realized the significance of money, and certainly never
                  dreamed how cheerfully virtue may starve, for all that any one cares. It could not
                  be done, quoth I, little thinking I should shortly rue it. So Lady Luck simply
                  shrugged her shoulders, and forthwith passed me by.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXVIII</head>
            <div>
               <head>Darker Reason</head>
               <p>The season closed, and almost immediately I found myself in the
                  thick of domestic calamities. And what maddening calamities they were to us girls!
                  In reckless autumnal burgeoning, our poor mothers produced a new crop of babies.
                  To no one’s joy, that we could see. It was nature, and the will of God and had to
                  be endured.</p>
               <p>Nature be damned, said we, fierce as fishwives. If other laws of
                  nature were circumvented and controlled, why should generation be the one
                  exception? Why indeed, thought we, glaring at each other helplessly. Tilly always
                  mild, demurred a little at such brazenness. It really wasn’t nice to talk about
                  such things, perhaps we might not have been born if people had been too wise.</p>
               <p>‘So what?’ demanded I. ‘What difference would it make?’ Of all the
                  crazy things peddled out to us, the craziest, to me, was the feeble twaddle about
                  being grateful for the gift of life. Who could be grateful for bleak existence
                  full of misery and deprivation? My own lot was beside the point. Before human
                  beings could be expected to render thanks for the burden of life, it should be
                  something better than the miserable scramble we saw all about us. Something less
                  cruel than history portrayed. What was more, said I, waxing furiously oratorical,
                  if that kind of craziness hadn’t been stuffed into people’s heads they wouldn’t
                  have made themselves paupers by having children they couldn’t decently feed! Even
                  children who weren’t fit to live!</p>
               <p>Whereupon I could have bitten my careless tongue. Tilly looked so
                  crushed. The Rhinertson baby, which, fortunately had died—some said it was
                  mercifully permitted to die—had been hideously misshapen. Scarcely human. And
                  other whispers had revived ancient scandal. Mrs. Rhinertson had herself to blame,
                  the wise protested. What could you expect, when you married your own uncle! It was
                  no wonder the children were puny—why, every one could see that the little girl who
                  preceded this—this mishap—wasn’t normal. The child was nearly four, and couldn’t
                  speak a word! Buzz, buzz, buzz, wherever two or three gathered. Poor Tilly,
                  meanwhile, creeping through her duties like a timid little mouse, her soft blue
                  eyes apologetic and ashamed.</p>
               <p>Laura frankly raged, a state of mind I understood quite thoroughly.
                  Whatever hope she may have entertained of financial assistance was completely
                  blasted. Doctor’s bills and a new baby were hardly the sort of inducements which
                  would persuade her stepfather to invest in her education.</p>
               <p>‘It is crazy!’ Laura shouted. ‘Nobody wanted
                  that baby—least of all, mamma. I can’t stand it! Everything gets worse and worse.
                  Somehow, I’ll get away. I’d rather starve trying to make something of myself.
                  There’s nothing for me at home. Nothing, nothing, nothing. It’s a holy mess, and
                  I’m getting out. What’s more, if I ever get ahead, I’ll see to it little Elma gets
                  a chance.’</p>
               <p>Minnie Nelson, though less bitter, was just as resentful. Theirs
                  was a happy, moderately comfortable home, where goodwill and a natural love of
                  music created a cheerful atmosphere. They were all good-looking, and good-natured,
                  and even the littlest tot sang as gaily as a wren. Just the same, there were too
                  many of them, Minnie contended, as dourly as her blithe soul permitted. ‘The kids
                  are smart, but what good does it do if they can’t even get music lessons.’</p>
               <p>None too cheerfully, I mulled this over as I sewed the tiny
                  garments for our own prospective blessing. Sewed them well, since sew I must, for
                  mamma’s eyesight was seriously affected. No angel of mercy, resentment worked like
                  yeast in my mind. Whirling the old machine, I thought of the millions of women
                  committed to this sort of thing, world without end. To drudgery, and pinching, and
                  those niggardly economies that stifle the spirit and slay all hope.</p>
               <p>To what conceivable end, I wonder. Was it so important to
                  perpetuate this dreary existence? If so, important to whom? To the churches, that
                  they might have these miserables on whom to practise humiliating charity? To the
                  State, that it might extort tithes and services? To the ‘Big Bosses’, whom little
                  Sam hated so fiercely?</p>
               <p>Oh, I had listened to his reviling with attentive ears, despite my
                  seeming indifference. Something of the hope he placed in his sacred unions was at
                  least partially clear. But how effective could union protection of labourers hope
                  to become, with the market glutted with unskilled workers? It was all very
                  confusing, and beyond my depths, yet one thing was certain: all that fine
                  balderdash about the glory of motherhood could stand a bit of cool dissecting. All
                  that mother-child glorification that ended in the cradle. It was time, it seemed
                  to me, that the serious thought should embrace the future of those hallowed
                  infants. A kiss or two in infancy was meagre compensation for a lifetime of bitter
                  bread!</p>
               <p>I had seen many broken creatures, had heard so much that was woeful
                  and sad. I thought of Big Tom, sitting, of a summer night, watching the sunset
                  with brooding, lustreless eyes, his whole expression so darkly withdrawn as to put
                  me in mind of a passing hearse. What did he mourn, sitting there? What once fair
                  dream lay dead in his heart?</p>
               <p>That was the tormenting thought that drove me for comfort to the
                  quiet hills, to the small, green coulees, where the sun dappled the tender grass
                  with dancing motes of gold. It was there, and not in any church, that God became a
                  reality, a living, healing influence, that eased my troubled mind. Here, in the
                  quiet hills, where little swift creatures sped on soundless feet and the whirr of
                  tiny wings ascending conspired to create a sense of joyous purposes, it was not so
                  hard to think, with Tennyson:</p>
               <!-- rend=';' -->
               <p>That nothing walks on aimless feet,</p>
               <p>  That not one life shall be destroyed</p>
               <p>  Or cast as rubbish to the void,</p>
               <p>When God has made the pile complete;</p>
               <p rend="noindent">not so hard to apply to my own small need, the poet’s fine
                  dreaming:</p>
               <!-- rend=';' -->
               <p>The hills are shadows, and they flow</p>
               <p>  From form to form, and nothing stands;</p>
               <p>  They melt like mist, the solid lands,</p>
               <p>Like clouds they shape themselves and go.</p>
               <p rend="noindent"> </p>
               <p>But in my spirit will I dwell,</p>
               <p>  And dream my dream, and hold it true;</p>
               <p>  For though my lips may breath adieu,</p>
               <p>I cannot think the thing farewell.</p>
               <p>How many errant tears I wept into the tender grass on those quiet
                  slopes, stirred to the quick by so many illusive images that teased the mind,
                  carried far beyond my own fears into the wider sea of universal experience. For
                  that was the queer thing in me no one understood. I could never free myself from
                  the tentacles of the eternal years. I wanted to be happy, but demanded a happiness
                  that had some deeper meaning than creature enjoyments that die on a breath,
                  leaving only dull ashes behind. I had seen too much of ash heaps!</p>
               <p>Where to seek such an excellent state was a mystery. I only knew
                  that life without purpose, joy without meaning, was a betrayal of those inner
                  impulses of the soul that linked all mankind, living and dead. It was not an
                  intellectual concept, nor any idea gleaned from prose. It was something that
                  flowed through me when I lay on the grass on that old hill-side, watching the
                  tangled clouds, or the low, winding valley that unrolled to the dark blue water of
                  the bay. Something out of the elements themselves, that seemed to carry my
                  thoughts backward into other times, where the forgotten dead had joyed and
                  sorrowed. Always the one thought I carried away, the one abiding determination: to
                  keep, against the world, my own little fragment of that mysterious quality in man
                  which gives him the power to dream.</p>
               <p>Something else I discovered. These thoughts of mine were unwelcome
                  and annoying to others. It was queer, and definitely boring, to speak of anything
                  so vague as a haunting feeling of kinship with ages past. It was sheer affectation
                  to utter anything save moth-eaten commonplaces. Yet people read, I supposed;
                  suffered, without complaint, the homilies of scribes. They went to church, and,
                  apparently, listened to scriptural passages that rolled like grandest organ music.
                  Yet none of this coloured their speech, dignified the structure of their mental
                  images. And for any one else to attempt a poetic phrase, however spontaneous, was
                  as shockingly out of place as to breathe the name of God.</p>
               <p>Oh, I had more than enough to learn. Much that was paradoxical and
                  depressing to the eager thing in my mind, enhungered for intelligent revelation.
                  Consequently, I burrowed deeper into my protective shell, adopting as best I could
                  the facile insincerities that pass for thought and feeling.</p>
               <p>Fortunately, the business of living devoured so much time that
                  these moody speculations were hardly more than an occasional luxury. A new baby
                  makes more work than a dozen adults. It seemed to me that I was always rushing
                  about buying nipples, bottles, lime water, peppermint, and goodness knows
                  what-not.</p>
               <p>The buying of groceries, every sort of errand, had to be done, all
                  of which ate up the precious hours. Hours I needed for study and the important
                  business of making my graduation address. Believe me, that took a shred of
                  ingenuity and anxious thought.</p>
               <p>Papa had given me two dollars, with which I was determined to
                  uphold the family honour. Fortune favoured me. I found some dotted Swiss marked
                  down to twenty-five cents the yard. With five yards safe in the crook of my arm,
                  and three spools of thread in my pocket, I raced for Woolworth’s, to purchase a
                  fearsome tangle of lace and insertion. Thus committed, I must, forsooth, treadle
                  miles and miles of intricate stitching, mostly by lamplight, to the tune of many a
                  headache and sundry crimps in the erstwhile valuable legs. The dress eventually
                  emerged, flatteringly, and mightily pleasing to vanity. Thought I, triumphantly,
                  how proud mamma would be of me. Why, even my aunt would take no shame, and perhaps
                  my cousin would think me less the gawky lout. Unless the cloudy mirror lied to
                  console me, I really looked quite nice.</p>
               <p>When the brave day dawned, however, not a single relative was
                  present to commend me. Not a soul. Though long since I had meticulously peddled
                  out my five tickets. To further deepen the hurt, what I had most set my heart
                  upon, for which I had striven to reach the highest standing—the valedictory—was
                  denied at the last moment.</p>
               <p>It chanced we had a singer in the class. So Gladys represented our
                  school by warbling, ‘Go, Pretty Rose’, and the world must wag along without my
                  painstaking wisdom. To make everything quite perfect, I developed an infection in
                  my right foot, and thought I should never squeeze into my adorable new
                  slippers.</p>
               <p>By the time I reached the high school the pain was so intense I
                  wondered how I should drag through the ordeal of endless speeches, endless
                  chatter, of girls whose parents beamed enraptured from the benches. Endless
                  exhortations to youth, standing at the portals of a rosy future!</p>
               <p>What did I care for those fine-sounding words just then! How could
                  I believe in a rosy future when not a soul cared a fig whether I had acquitted
                  myself well or ill. When every nerve in my body ached with longing for some tiny
                  gesture of pleased affection, how should I credit the goodwill of the fortuitous
                  world, painted so grandly by glib little gentlemen vestured like penguins?</p>
               <p>I was not quite alone, I discovered. Where my own failed me, a
                  friend came to the rescue. Carl was there to pilot me, sweet and kind and patient
                  with my limping. For that I must always love him! For being there; for
                  understanding, without comment, the source of my depression. And if I cried a
                  little when I stole to bed that night, it was less for the hurt in my heart than
                  the dear knowledge that a good friend is sufficient unto any ill day.</p>

               <head>Again Green Pastures</head>
               <p>Life broke in strange and complex patterns. Papa had the wanderlust
                  again. He had been receiving glowing letters from my eldest brother, who, after
                  knocking about the sea, had settled in the south. I suspect that, like dear papa,
                  this light-hearted brother saw everything in brighter colours than is given to
                  more cautious souls to see. At any rate, papa took such a fancy to the picture he
                  painted of life in Mississippi that, against every one’s counsel, and to mamma’s
                  heartbreak, he sold the house and everything else that mamma’s economy had made
                  possible, and off we went on the mad adventure.</p>
               <p>What was to become of my higher education? What of the normal
                  course my hope was set upon as the first step to glory? Oh well, there were
                  schools everywhere, said he. If not, I might find a rich husband. Anything was
                  likely to happen in the paradise he envisioned. Mamma, a little grim, devoutly
                  hoped that, at least, we’d find something to eat, and a roof to shelter us.</p>
               <p>The journey down the Mississippi valley was not without interest.
                  Those interminable miles through black plains vast as the sea; through strange
                  cities and towns, so different from anything I had seen before, stirring the
                  liveliest speculations, and somewhat reviving my sinking hopes. Perhaps we were
                  not heading into sheer disaster, as mamma predicted.</p>
               <p>When we crossed the Mason and Dixon line, coming to a stop at a
                  station where hundreds of coal-black faces stared up from the station platform, I
                  lost sight of worry. What a spectacle that was! Never had I dreamt that so many
                  black people could congregate! Never had I seen so many wide grins, such gleaming
                  teeth, such multi-coloured, billowing skirts, and bright turbans. While at every
                  window, black hands offered snowy baskets of fried chicken, golden-brown, and
                  irresistible.</p>
               <p>What supersedes every other memory, however, was our first view of
                  an immense cotton-field. Acres of bursting cotton, that seemed to float in the
                  coral light of a setting sun, like so many millions of ghostly roses. Of all the
                  beauty to come, the most beautiful, thought I. Yet when the field lay at our backs
                  we found ourselves streaming through a pine forest that must have stood tall and
                  stately when the world was young.</p>
               <p>I had thought the Minnesota pines grand beyond dreaming. I had
                  watched them felled in a lumber camp with a constriction of the heart as each
                  giant fell, so convinced was I that something superlative and irreplacable was
                  being stripped from the earth. But here were trees that soared up into the blue
                  with the proud elation of creative thought. Pillars of living grace, to bring the
                  heart of man to the dust in worship of the lovely earth that bore such beauty in
                  her breast.</p>
               <p>But, at last, the long lap of the journey ended. We came to a stop
                  in the midst of what seemed empty wilderness, and, stiff and dirty, piled off bag
                  and baggage. Not quite empty, we perceived—some yards away stood an unpainted
                  shack, the station, towards which we stumbled in quest of information. Entering
                  the gloomy box, I looked around, perplexed. Where was the station-master, I
                  wondered.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, a panel slid open in the dirty wall, and a rusty voice
                  barked at me: ‘You-all can’t stay there, Missy! Come round, Missy, come
                  round.’</p>
               <p>‘I only want to ask——’ I began, and was interrupted sharply.</p>
               <p>‘Cain’t you-all read?’ the worthy ancient queried indignantly,
                  pointing to a sign I had failed to see in the murk: ‘Coloured
                     Waiting-Room’.</p>
               <p>Meek as milk, I trotted round to a twin cell reserved for the
                  exalted white race, and forthwith was informed that a jitney would come in due
                  course barring acts of God or other violence. ’Bout an hour, he guessed. The
                  freedom of the field was ours, and right welcome we were in these parts.</p>
               <p>Mamma settled down on a box with the baby. The children scampered
                  off like kittens. Papa strolled sedately, inhaling with audible relish the
                  remarkable air. Such fragrance! cried he. Such soft, sweet ozone! He felt another
                  man. How warm it was! Warm as a summer’s day, and this October. Imagine how we’d
                  feel stranded in the open at such an hour by the shores of Lake Superior!</p>
               <p>Our jitney joggled into view, and, with the patience of Griselda,
                  set off again through the wood, fetching up at last before a rambling, unpainted
                  structure in the village of Buckatunna. We had arrived.</p>
               <p>This dusty road, solitary building, and a gloomy bulk beyond a
                  clump of trees, was all the town we could see. Mamma’s face set in a bleak mask
                  that not even my brother’s fond greeting could melt.</p>
               <p>We cheered somewhat after a good wash, and the dinner Minty’s
                  southern wife had thoughtfully prepared. In the evening we drifted to the porch
                  and tried to get our bearings. In the white moonlight the road turned silver, and
                  the shadows cast by the great trees were more purple than black, except where huge
                  masses formed midnight banks against the sky.</p>
               <p>The town, we now perceived, was a scattering of houses on either
                  side the most crooked river in the world. Houses all alike, tossed up for
                  temporary use in this temporary town, which depended on the mills for its living.
                  A few homes on the other side of the Chickasahay had been built with some better
                  end in view, but those on our side were nothing but ugly boxes, without
                  conveniences of any kind. There were no industries, nothing but the mills, and,
                  beyond the town, small planters, who lived from hand to mouth. Not a promising
                  prospect for papa, who, I imagined, had laboured some hope of starting a harness
                  shop.</p>
               <p>There was charm here for the poet. A sort of sleepy grace enfolded
                  the ramshackle town. At midday the sandy road which was its main artery lay softly
                  golden in the glittering light, and over it ambled many a darky wench in bright
                  green petticoat, and basket on her head. Strings of oxen slept before the
                  store—long teams of them, with sometimes an old blind beast for leader. Now and
                  then a horseman cantered by, raising a fine amber cloud, and making scarcely a
                  sound in the soft dust. And everywhere were fierce razor-back pigs that streaked
                  along on incredibly nimble legs from one unseemly rooting place to another. Built
                  in an hour, destined for a day, the village had something primeval about it.
                  Something old as time, and imperturbable as the trees whose death song hummed all
                  day long from the greedy mills.</p>
               <p>Of the people I shall have more to say by and by. My first
                  impression was confined to the strict divisions imposed. The same division of
                  sheep from goats everywhere accepted as right and proper, but here more
                  noticeable, because more honestly and openly avowed than in sophisticated society.
                  It seemed that quite respectable but less highly paid mortals lived on our side of
                  the river; the gentry of the mills on the other. At a nice distance from the
                  respectability sprawled ‘Hell’s Half-Acre’, the dubious district dedicated to the
                  misfits and the disreputable. Beyond that, again, lay the Negro quarter, where
                  some two thousand cheery black folk disported themselves in their own fashion. I
                  think, if I remember rightly, that the white population numbered about eight
                  hundred.</p>
               <p>Of course, I got into trouble right away. Always accustomed to
                  ramble about the hills at home, I set off one late afternoon on a tour of
                  discovery, only to reach home long after dark to find mamma almost in tears, and
                  my brother in a nervous rage. He had always been very dear to me, this brother who
                  had cared for me so often when I was little and mamma was working elsewhere. His
                  anger was prompted by genuine anxiety. A sound riot act he served on me!</p>
               <p>Women did not run about the woods down here. They went nowhere
                  unescorted after dark. Only a few days since a negro had been lynched for a brutal
                  assault upon a white woman! I was to behave myself, henceforth, and if I must
                  traipse about the countryside I should have to wait until some nice young man
                  offered to satisfy my curiosity.</p>
               <p>My next misdemeanour was to offend such a nice young man. There was
                  a good band in the village, led by my brother, and one of the boys very
                  courteously sent me a note by a little black messenger proposing a drive through
                  the country. Well, we youngsters back home were not very formal. Certainly I’d
                  like to go, said I to the piccaninny, and left it at that.</p>
               <p>The young man did not arrive. He was deeply insulted. I should have
                  replied in kind, not trusting such a personal letter to a coloured boy.</p>
               <p>I was rescued from the threat of oblivion by a personable
                  individual who was bookkeeper at the general store. Which, in a manner of
                  speaking, brings me to my first serious love affair—never an easy subject.
                  Complete evasion of intimate experiences would scarcely be honest. On the other
                  hand, there is an element of unkindness in exploiting the feelings of others for
                  which I have little taste.</p>
               <p>However, a casual survey of the women men presumably love and
                  marry, poor darlings, reveals an amazing democracy and forbearance—sufficiently
                  astonishing to lead one to believe that any female clothed in a whole skin must
                  have had a lover. Toss in a bit of whimsy and humour, and the possibilities are
                  boundless. This precious fact must serve as my defence. My relationships with men
                  have been extremely fortunate. For which I thank a plain face and a sense of
                  humour. Safe as a salt block from the purely predatory male, I should, none the
                  less, fall short of truth contending that masculine charity had passed me by. Life
                  is not so cruel as that!</p>
               <p>To continue: Bob duly presented himself, and carried me off to some
                  sort of party on the elect side of the river. He was an amiable sort, and took no
                  offence when his best friend whisked me off his hands. This high-handed individual
                  had an impish eye, devilry all over him, and a most engaging manner. Not handsome,
                  except for those brown, mischievous eyes and a lighting of his face when he
                  laughed—the kind of laugh that puts you in mind of music, and moonlight, and
                  spangled Christmas trees.</p>
               <p>Every one grinned at the mere mention of Gordon Bannister. A
                  likeable rapscallion, said the villagers. A rapscallion, none the less.
                  Unconscionable flirt, he spent his money like water, had no serious thought in his
                  head, and for all that any one knew he might have a brace of wives in Mobile, he
                  flittered thither so often. What was even more reprehensible, not being a native
                  of these parts, but a suspect product of Little Rock, Arkansas, he was callously
                  indifferent to the hopes he raised in palpitating country bosoms.</p>
               <p>This charming plague took it into his head to herd me out of that
                  party into the silken treachery of moonlight and leafy lane, so dear to the heart
                  of poets brewing doom for guileless females. As if that were not enough, the mad
                  young man raved like a book, expertly exploiting every shade of sentiment and all
                  the gradations of a fluent voice. For a mile or more I stood the strain of it
                  without breaking. Then, I’m sorry to say, the humour of it ran away with me.</p>
               <p>Midways of a most romantic bridge that spanned the sleepiest of
                  serpentine rivers, I—to quote the wounded gentleman—threw a fit: shrieked with
                  laughter to the shuddering skies, and to the disquiet of every self-respecting
                  water snake and slumberous alligator. Presently, we were both hanging helplessly
                  over the rail, poor poetry dead as a smoked herring.</p>
               <p>‘You’re a nasty creature,’ said the young man, when breath
                  permitted. ‘Nasty, unfeeling little friend. How about it—shall we be friends, you
                  monkey?’</p>
               <p>‘Why not? I want to see the country, and I can’t run about with my
                  shadow.’</p>
               <p>‘That’s what I call a noble spirit,’ quoth he. ‘But what a
                  disappointing audience! Here I strain my heart putting up a good show, and what do
                  I get for it? Not a gentle twitter! What was wrong with it, pray?’</p>
               <p>‘Just everything. A good show works up to the climax—or hadn’t you
                  thought of that?’ said I, glad of the chatter. There would be more than enough of
                  monotony when I got back to the cluttered rooms we called home. It was lovely,
                  being there, where the moonlight played whitely over the opaque waters of the
                  slow, coiling river moving soundlessly under the black shadows of the heavy trees.
                  And what girl of seventeen can fail to be a little thrilled at the pleasant lies
                  of a gay young man with the gleam of devilry in his eyes?</p>
               <p>‘Oh, I see,’ he retorted. ‘You have a nice taste in conquest. Well,
                  I shall mend my manners, I promise you. I’ll map out a plan in easy stages before
                  asking you to come for a drive. Now tell me, what on earth brought you to this
                  God-forsaken place?’</p>
               <p>That was not for me to explain to a stranger so I changed the
                  subject, switching to my curiosity about the country, the mills that were
                  devouring a sea of timber, the little sprawling village, and the people, whose way
                  of life was so strange. So we hung there, upon the splintered rail, for how long
                  only the stars knew, while Bannister told me how northern capital was financing
                  the timber operations in this most backward of southern states. Poverty and
                  inertia were the curse of Mississippi, said he. The last state to be laid waste by
                  the Civil War, it had not yet gained a normal rhythm of existence—quite possibly
                  would never gain its former peace and security.</p>
               <p>Some day, he would take me to see an old ruined plantation that
                  would tell the tale better than words. For himself, he was here for the time
                  being, because he made a good living. When he had saved a little money he was
                  going back where he’d never see another confounded mill, and where you could think
                  of trees in better terms than so many feet of boarding. If it wasn’t for the
                  occasional jamboree in Mobile, that kept him from going crazy, he’d never have
                  stuck it this long. Why, the highlights of existence here were wakes and
                  christenings—and of neither enough to wear out a pair of shoes!</p>
               <p>Hardly enheartening, yet when I slipped into the silent house it
                  was not to envision wakes but to wonder if I should hear again that easy voice
                  juggling truth and fancy under the stars. He was going to Mobile for the week-end,
                  he said, but promised to redeem a bad beginning when he came back. What was a
                  promise to a lunatic young man who lied like a poet, and cheerfully admitted the
                  fact, thought I gloomily, braiding my hair for the night. Was it conceivable that
                  nothing more entrancing than city lights prompted those weekly flights into
                  Alabama? No, not likely, I told myself sensibly, and decided to make my peace with
                  Bob.</p>

               <head>Magic Moonlight</head>
               <p>The next day I had little time to worry about Gordon Bannister,
                  although, as might be expected, mamma demanded a character sketch. What sort of
                  person was this young man, she wanted to know? Did brother know anything about his
                  people? Brother thought they were sound in mind and marrow, but Gordon was a
                  fickle wretch, and I’d be well advised to remember that he was not a kid like
                  myself.</p>
               <p>‘I don’t expect my daughters to be fools!’ snapped mamma. With
                  which remark Bannister was shelved, and a real grievance presented. We were short
                  of milk for the baby! The folk from whom we had purchased the vital supply had
                  lost their cow. That is to say, it had wandered away, and no one had sufficient
                  energy to hunt for the beast. Cows, like pigs, were free souls in these parts, and
                  usually paraded whither they listed, companioned by nudging calfs. Cannibalism
                  would have shocked mamma less. Fancy fighting with a calf for your milk each
                  evening! Was ever such thriftlessness! And what to do? The baby couldn’t digest
                  condensed milk, nor could he wait upon the whim of a cow making an infrequent
                  social call.</p>
               <p>Oh, it would work out somehow, papa comforted, nervously helping
                  himself to a pinch of snuff. The cow was sure to turn up sooner or later. If he
                  knew what the creature looked like, he’d hunt for her himself. My sister-in-law
                  had a more concrete suggestion. The Wilmots, on the far side of the river, had a
                  good milch cow on which they kept a sharp eye because of their own brood of young
                  ones. They might spare us a pint or two, she imagined. In any case, it would be a
                  pleasant trip for me. Betty Wilmot was about my own age, and quite a nice
                  girl.</p>
               <p>This enheartened mamma, who fetched another difficulty. There were
                  no decent washing facilities. Just a huge, black cauldron in the back-yard. How on
                  earth was she to struggle with the laundry under such circumstances? Oh, that was
                  nothing, shouted my little sister. All you did was light a fire under the pot,
                  fill it with water and soap, pitch in the clothes, and stir with a stick. She had
                  seen it done in the next yard, and it looked awfully jolly. She was sure she could
                  do it herself. She’d prove it by doing the baby clothes. And so she did, making a
                  better job at eight than I at thirty.</p>
               <p>The problem was not so easily settled, however. No self-respecting
                  white woman did her own laundry. Whatever the pinch of the purse, a negress must
                  do the wash and save our face. Heavens above! Mamma sank down weakly. Here was a
                  pretty tangle of thistles! Imagine being above a healthy tussle with the washtub,
                  when everything else was primitive as Noah’s Ark! Nothing irritated mamma so much
                  as vanity, unless it was a dishcloth that could not hold its own with a summer
                  cloud for cleanliness. She had nothing whatever against coloured people—the Lord
                  must have known what he was doing when he made them—but that was no reason to
                  trust them with the few bits of household linen that doubtless would have to serve
                  for the rest of our lives.</p>
               <p>Small wonder I should forget Mr. Bannister and his blandishments
                  when our very sheets were threatened! Small wonder I should gape like a ninny
                  when, about sundown, a tattered little messenger staggered up the steps with a
                  huge basket of fruit, bedecked with tissue paper and bow knots. It was for me, the
                  beaming black midget assured me. But that could not be! There was some mistake.
                  Who on earth would be sending me a carload of fruit?</p>
               <p>‘Don’t stand there arguing with the child!’ Mamma’s voice was
                  faintly amused. ‘Suppose you try looking inside. That might tell the tale.’</p>
               <p>Sure enough, there was the card, with my name on it, written in a
                  beautiful, flowing hand, and something else, which, to read under mamma’s
                  scrutiny, turned me red as a tomato.</p>
               <p>‘Well, don’t be foolish—who sent it? The dangerous young man, I’ll
                  be bound!’</p>
               <p>‘Yes, he did,’ I mumbled. ‘Mr. Bannister, I mean—he didn’t seem so
                  dangerous to me.’</p>
               <p>‘So that’s the kind of a lad he is!’ twinkled mamma, and, laughing
                  for the first time in days, she resumed her interrupted task.</p>
               <p>That was the beginning. Two days later, another mysterious package
                  found its way to the house. Then three days went by, and along came little Moses
                  with a huge box of candy. This time, a note was tucked under the wrapping.</p>
               <p>‘A discreet opening, don’t you think?’ it said, and I could almost
                  hear the letters laughing in every loop and line.</p>
               <p>It was enough to give any girl palpitation of the heart, especially
                  when another week-end went by without a sign of the mischievous sender. By midweek
                  I could have scratched his eyes out. He was making a fool of me, I felt sure. Why,
                  every time I went to the store Bob, now grave as a bishop, asked after these
                  odious parcels, their assembling having been left to him. But he studiously
                  avoided recalling that he had promised to show me some of the places of
                  interest.</p>
               <p>Mad as a hornet, I laid myself out to flatter a susceptible
                  cornet-player who came to practise with my brother, and was rewarded with an
                  invitation to go driving the next Sunday night.</p>
               <p>All a-flutter, and carefully arrayed in the second best of my two
                  good dresses, a violet-coloured garment which I had made with great care, there I
                  sat, in the gentle dusk, triumphantly waiting the carriage wheels. Eight o’clock
                  came and went, and minutes slowly ticked off another hour. By half-past nine I was
                  in a pretty dither, and by ten o’clock I was so boiling mad that I could have
                  kicked a cat. There was nothing I could do about it, however, except to
                  demonstrate contentment whenever mamma came to the door for a whiff of air. The
                  night was so beautiful, the moonlight so lovely, I could sit there for ever!
                  Which, thought I viciously, was exactly what I’d have to do for the rest of my
                  natural life, if this kept up.</p>
               <p>Then, materializing so suddenly that I could scarcely believe my
                  eyes, Mr. Gordon Bannister spoke out of the dusk:</p>
               <p>‘What a waste of fine weather! Surely you haven’t been sitting
                  here, alone, all night?’</p>
               <p>‘I’m not such bad company,’ I snapped crossly, wondering what had
                  become of the clever things I had meant to say, completely forgetting to thank him
                  for all those suspicious presents.</p>
               <p>‘I’d never have guessed it,’ he laughed at me. ‘You have such a
                  nasty way of hiding it. I could have sworn you were cursing your poor grandmother,
                  just now. Or was that rapture on your innocent brow?’</p>
               <p>No use fencing with the amiable wretch. Whatever I said, he’d make
                  hash of it. And, besides, if I were rude, mamma would be sure to hear it through
                  the open window, and upbraid me soundly for lack of manners. I parried with a
                  question in my nicest voice:</p>
               <p>‘Why aren’t you in Mobile? I thought you went there every
                  week-end?’</p>
               <p>‘Oh, tastes change. I got tired of red hair. Look here, couldn’t
                  you enjoy your own company just as well, down the road a bit? Perambulating
                  meditation is so good for the soul.’</p>
               <p>‘I’d like to see Hell’s Half-Acre,’ said I. ‘That’s the kind of
                  mood I’m in.’</p>
               <p>‘Don’t doubt it,’ he laughed. ‘Just the same, you’ll get the
                  opposite direction, my sweet. I want to show you something to touch the heart of a
                  stone.’</p>
               <p>What we went to see was a glorious old oak that stood by itself at
                  the crook of the river. A tree so perfect it might have been the model for all
                  sublime poetry. Covered in trailing Spanish moss that looked like silver veils in
                  the moonlight, it had an unearthly beauty, as of something seen in a vision, full
                  of mystery and significant beyond immediate comprehension.</p>
               <p>I have always been susceptible to such impressions—quickly elated,
                  yet as quickly depressed with a feeling of limitation. A finer spirit must sense
                  so much hidden from me: draw so much closer to the heart of beauty. There is
                  always an element of sadness in deeply moving loveliness. It was so now.
                  Speechless, scarcely conscious of my fumbling reactions, I could only watch the
                  sweet wizardry of the moonlight playing upon the lovely shoulders of the bridal
                  oak; stand there, faintly sad in a silence that pressed upon consciousness,
                  forcing the heart to quicker rhythm, the mind to subtler comprehension. Here, if
                  anywhere, are all dreams gathered up. Time loses its relative meaning, and the
                  ghost of all treasured desire blossoms with life.</p>
               <p>From across the woodland the melancholy cry of the whip-poor-will
                  thrust its little sword of sweet complaint; a tiny, troubled sound that shook the
                  silence. Apprehensively, I glanced at my unknown companion, and saw, with relief,
                  how still he was, stripped of the smart mask that grinned at the world. Then,
                  snapping back to the familiar, he said impatiently:</p>
               <p>‘It’s too easy to lose one’s self. Come away, before we forget how
                  bright we are.’</p>
               <p>Back we went to the little bridge, and now I remembered how cross I
                  was with this cheerful imbecile, who, I somehow felt, was responsible for my
                  frustrated evening’s pleasure. As though he caught the changing mood, he
                  forestalled with able strategy my boiling accusation by calmly telling me that
                  poor Jim had had some trouble with the buggy. That’s what he had really come to
                  tell me—that, and, of course, to offer Jim’s apology.</p>
               <p>Thought I, whatever the mischief, you are the cause! But I realized
                  there was no use charging the gentleman with grappling-irons. However. I wriggled
                  in my skin—knowing that he was laughing at me, I doffed my spleen before a
                  seemingly impenetrable armour. Nevertheless, there is always some vulnerable space
                  even in coats of mail, I reminded myself, and devoutly vowed to find it. Somehow,
                  I’d make this charming creature squirm. He was so sorry I should have been
                  disappointed. It broke his heart to think of my anxious hours on the porch
                  watching the moon flirting through the tree-tops! ‘Well then,’ said I, sweet as
                  carbolic acid, ‘while you’re so full of pity, why not offer to show me that
                  plantation you were talking about.’</p>
               <p>A bright thought, he agreed, his brown eyes crinkling at me, but
                  naturally, he would have to sleep on it a week or two. Since I refused to be
                  tormented, he tacked round to current gossip and local history, all dressed with
                  ironic humour. So we parted in amicable spirits, and, said he, if I really behaved
                  myself, I should see that forlorn reminder of a glorified myth.</p>
               <p>But I did not behave myself. By midweek I was full of nagging aches
                  and pains, sudden waves of fever, and gripping sensations in my midriff. For a day
                  or two, I kept to my feet, then, in a surge of fury, the fever mounted, my head
                  hummed like a hive of bees, and nothing but pain had any meaning. I had
                  malaria.</p>

            <div>
               <head>Deep Interval</head>
               <p>Of the first horrible siege I remember little: interludes of ague,
                  hard on the heels of consuming fire, when the sweat froze on my body, the muscles
                  jumped on my bones, and no matter how many covers were piled on the bed, the cold
                  of the grave shook me to the marrow. Half-hour interludes when I was conscious
                  that a million devils plucked my brain, beat on my skull, pricked my eyeballs, and
                  chewed along the edges of my spine. Then, back to the hell of flame, where the
                  only reality was the shrieking voice of an everlasting thirst. A tortuous,
                  inescapable frenzy, that nothing quieted. Whatever liquid passed the lips dried on
                  the swollen tongue; boiled away with the boiling blood that hissed in the writhing
                  veins and threw up a sickening odour more hideous than all the rest. This
                  nauseating reek that clung to every breath was what finally drove me nearly crazy.
                  It is no exaggeration to say that the thought of death seemed a blessed escape
                  without terror of any kind.</p>
               <p>Swift as its rushing crisis, the fever broke, one strange morning.
                  The sunlight streaming under the lowered blind was sweet to see, comforting to
                  follow on its wavering quest through the ugly room. There, like old familiar
                  faces, were the few sticks of furniture mamma had salvaged. The sober bureau, in
                  whose mirrored eye I had measured the progress of my graduation dress; that had so
                  often witnessed the struggle of putting up my hair. The battered chair, that
                  seemed to give back mamma’s voice reading some ancient tale. Even the stiff
                  enlargements of infant pictures were welcome sights. When mamma herself stepped in
                  with a bowl of steaming soup I could have wept with happiness, only, somehow or
                  other, I had no tears. I felt as dried up as a withered stalk of corn. And what a
                  sight to behold!</p>
               <p>Yellow as a hoe-cake, the skin on my bones like sandpaper; even my
                  hair a lustreless mop! It came away in dead tufts under mamma’s gentle fingers.
                  Secretly grieved, she comforted me. It would grow back in no time, beautiful as
                  ever. She had lost all her hair when she came to this country, and mark what a
                  decent recompense she had.</p>
               <p>That was the least of my worries, my hair. Hairs I could spare by
                  the millions, but oh, what a face to bare to the merry glance of the spruce young
                  doctor who came to dose me with quinine and cod-liver oil! How on earth should I
                  venture past the door with a complexion like a cracked egg?</p>
               <p>La, what a dither! All forgotten in a twinkling, the sunny day I
                  shamedly set forth with smiling Mr. Bannister to see the famed plantation.</p>
               <p>It was a sad old house, sitting disconsolate amidst neglected fruit
                  trees, dead as joys long fled; cotton-fields slipping back to wilderness; sagging
                  slave quarters settling to ruin. The sole survivor of the family was in Mobile,
                  penniless, as lost in the new world as the ghostly house in this kingdom of
                  decay.</p>
               <p>Other scenes, though less romantic, raised a host of questions in
                  my mind. The small tenant farms with primitive cabins that often lacked even
                  window-panes and the furnishings of which reminded me of the makeshift equipment
                  of the first Icelandic settlers. The more thrifty had a grist mill or a cotton gin
                  to supplement the meagre living, for meagre it must be, despite the fertile soil
                  and semi-tropical climate, if appearances might be trusted. I had seen more hope
                  in the faces of Norwegian women hoeing their bits of field among the tree stumps
                  of northern Minnesota, than here, where listlessness and apathy seemed to have
                  reduced every one to the same ageless antiquity. A dry rot of indifference cast a
                  blight everywhere. And this was the Eden of papa’s hopes!</p>
               <p>If such cheerless thoughts intruded upon my happiest hours, what
                  must mamma have suffered, shut up with despair for ever-present company! With not
                  even a house of her own to occupy her restless energy, and utter ruin ahead, what
                  chilling anxiety she bore with silent fortitude. How good she was to urge me out
                  into the sunlight, to the small gaieties that came my way!</p>
               <p>Simple pastimes. A visit to Bannister’s sister, whose house was a
                  little oasis of comfort in this comfortless place. Walks through the woods,
                  pungent with the scent of pine after the sheets of rain that washed the world
                  clean. We spied on Hell’s Half-Acre; hung on the fringe of the Negro quarters,
                  listening to plaintive spirituals and old familiar hymns jollied up to revival
                  glee. Sometimes we went to the meeting-house, where an earnest mortal exhorted us
                  to forgo the flesh and the devil. Nothing unusual or startling, except the wake to
                  which I went, with a jumbled feeling of curiosity and distaste.</p>
               <p>From the look of it, all the village was there. Every Jack and Jill
                  in Sunday best and blameless humour. How carefully they kept the proprieties: turn
                  and turnabout, gravely keeping watch with the dead, then back to the moonlit porch
                  to whisper discreet nothings to the enheartening thrill of clinging hands.</p>
               <p>Queer, thought I, and hypocritical. Others besides myself were
                  strangers to the dead man. Then why were they here? To relieve the family,
                  Bannister informed me, a little shortly. There was no hypocrisy in shouldering
                  this responsibility for the worn-out family who had to face the terrible
                  to-morrow.</p>
               <p>How soon and sharply this truth was borne home to me! Without
                  warning of any kind, my little brother Stanley woke one morning with a strange,
                  restricted feeling in the throat. Poor mamma, who had herself just come down with
                  the fever, was terrified, her thought flying back down the years to that dark
                  morning when I had suffered a similar experience.</p>
               <p>The doctor was instantly called, but neither he nor his young
                  assistant could do anything. In spite of their frantic efforts, the child was dead
                  at four o’clock. Of all the cruel blows life had dealt my dear mother, this was
                  most insufferable: to lie fast to her own bed, watching her little one die in
                  frightful agony.</p>
               <p>Then it was we came to know how much beauty of human kindness dwelt
                  in this ugly village. Women whose faces were strange and names unknown to this day
                  were suddenly in quiet possession of our shattered house. Without question, or a
                  single futile word these gentle Marthas set about the sad task that must be done.
                  With the deftness of long experience they cut and fashioned the shroud from a
                  length of soft white flannel. A young woman, with a sweet, sensitive face, cut
                  lacy-patterns into borders with which to line the small coffin their men were
                  making. Others, dim shadows in my mind, washed the little tormented body, now so
                  terribly still.</p>
               <p>Every detail of the funeral was assumed in the same devoted spirit,
                  with the unaffected manner of folk steeped in golden deeds. Except for this
                  inestimable kindness, I cannot think that mamma would have survived. She had lost
                  so many children in the starved days on the prairies.</p>
               <p>It was like a paralysing dream to be standing in the depths of a
                  pine forest, remote and still as some land of tragic allegory, watching the small
                  casket lowered in the earth; seeing papa weeping; knowing that now the mainspring
                  of his heart was broken. The spirit of hopeful yearning that had kept him young,
                  his eyes on the far horizon, no matter what the blows of circumstance, dead, with
                  the dear, small son whose death lay on his conscience. Terrible to feel these
                  things, to know them without shadow of doubting, and to have no ease of tears.
                  Bitter beyond telling, to read in papa’s grieving glance a hurt rebuke for my hard
                  indifference. How insensitive! How poor in spirit! This, his thought. This the
                  thought of others, whose tears fell lightly to the rhythm of volatile emotion.
                  Ills that shake the roots of thought link themselves with an eternity of human woe
                  for which no redress is possible, have always frozen my heart, turning inward the
                  shock of feeling, so futile in the face of endless pain.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXXII</head>
            <div>
               <head>Forced Decision</head>
               <p>Mamma rose from her sick-bed with only one thought, fixed and
                  clear. We must go back! But where to get the money for our fares was a humiliating
                  problem. For a time we pinned our hope on the tragic possibility that Stanley’s
                  insurance would save us all. The company repudiated the claim. The last payment on
                  the premium had reached them too late. My cousin, to whom the money was sent, had
                  forgotten to mail it in time. A lapse of three days!</p>
               <p>Papa swallowed his pride and appealed to my aunt and my
                  half-brother, a struggling young musician with cares enough, and his name to make.
                  While this correspondence went forward, our few bits of furniture, everything,
                  except our clothes and bedding had to be sold.</p>
               <p>I had the melancholy satisfaction of persuading Betty’s mother to
                  buy our fairly new carpet and some decent tea-cups. I knew how badly Betty wanted
                  to ‘pretty up’ the parlour, a cold-looking room where comfortless chairs were lost
                  in a sea of sanded floor. All the house was cheerless as an empty barn, yet there
                  must have been a time when the wide hall and high-ceilinged chambers breathed of
                  happiness and comfort. So much had I guessed when I paid my respects to Mrs.
                  Wilmot, lying in with another infant, none too willingly, judging from the mood
                  she was in.</p>
               <p>‘Declare there’s no end to misery,’ she greeted me, freeing one
                  hand from the infant she was guiding to her breast, to indicate a rocker near by.
                  ‘It kills you to have them and it kills you to feed them. Declare, it’s misery all
                  around!’</p>
               <p>The lobster-pink infant was only two days old, and the frail
                  anaemic mother was suffering stubborn after-pains. With each new baby, they got
                  worse and worse. If this kept on, it would get so that the after-pain met the pain
                  of labour. Nothing but misery, that’s what marriage was, yet look at Betty, honin
                  for a man!</p>
               <p>Whilst thus enlightened, I had time to observe that the bed in
                  which she fretted was of polished rosewood. So too, the bureau, which, together
                  with the rocker, completed the furnishings of the room. Enough to make me see the
                  house in better days; to make me wonder if the querulous woman with her small,
                  impatient face and inadequate hands, was not designed for softer living.</p>
               <p>As a matter of fact, the lady neither toiled nor spun. The house
                  might be empty, her progeny arrayed in a single cotton garment, and nothing in the
                  larder save a fletch of bacon, hominy, and rice. A negress came to cook the
                  evening meal. Mrs. Wilmot rocked in the shade, grumbling at the everlasting
                  babies, and calling desultory orders to poor Betty, who was as soft and
                  ineffectual as herself.</p>
               <p>Yes, Betty was thrilled to have the carpet and the cups. To the
                  best of our combined ability, we enheartened the room, washed the windows,
                  gathered greens, lit a fire in the grate, and celebrated her triumph and my coming
                  departure. Gordon Bannister was the supporting spirit of the occasion, as he had
                  been my sole comfort in the terrible days just passed. Something I had taken for
                  granted, without much thought. Adolescent blindness, due for a rude awakening!</p>
               <p>There came a day when the skeleton of our poverty was dragged into
                  the daylight—bone by bone, as it were, tossed upon the dining-room table. A
                  pitiful heap of greenbacks that no amount of faith could strengthen to our need.
                  Not nearly enough for all of us, said papa. Of course, he had been counting on me,
                  which was doubtless foolish of him, if I had elected to marry Mr. Bannister. The
                  young man had asked his permission very decently, and above board, etc.</p>
               <p>You could have heard my heart across the street! I was scared out
                  of my wits. Frightened to death to hear papa disposing of my precious future in
                  such terms as these. For the moment I didn’t think of Bannister at all. Neither
                  he, nor any one else had figured in my secret programme. And papa, who should have
                  understood the bent of my mind, calmly and even a little eagerly suggested that I
                  had elected to get married!</p>
               <p>Anger that was nine-tenths pain succeeded my astonishment. How
                  could my own parents wish me such a humdrum fate! Why did they stare at me with
                  grave patience, as though expecting me to justify their mean opinion! What did
                  they want me to say? That I was too dumb to realize that a man was in love with
                  me? That the crazy idea gave me a hollow feeling under the breastbone, but not a
                  single flutter of the heart? Oh, what was the use of saying anything, thought I,
                  bolting from the scene, and setting off on an agitated ramble. In the quiet of the
                  wood I began to think of Bannister—to feel horribly ashamed of myself to have been
                  so selfish and unseeing. The innumerable kindnesses I had accepted rose up to
                  accuse me, and all the agreeable characteristics of the young man himself ticked
                  off in my mind. I could have wished myself wings, and a hole in the moon. All of
                  which added up to the remarkable wisdom that, if I must marry somebody, it might
                  as well be Bannister!</p>
               <p>Mamma promptly nipped the noble resolution in the bud. If I had
                  only shown some sense, and not run off like a rabbit, I should have heard her
                  laying down the law for all of us. Naturally, she had been waiting to hear what I
                  had to say for myself, if anything. But never for a moment had she dreamed of
                  leaving me behind to make a fool of myself, like—like, well, so many people did
                  who couldn’t distinguish between fact and fancy.</p>
               <p>So mamma, at least, had not been content to sell me into bondage to
                  save a railway ticket. That was something gained. The young man himself was still
                  to be reckoned with, and not so lightly, it transpired. A bee in the bonnet was
                  nothing compared to the hornet that that erstwhile mortal had under his hat. We
                  finally compromised on a promise, to be redeemed or cancelled next summer, when,
                  presumably, my youthful mind was to have come to its full senses.</p>
               <p>Off, then, on the long back trail, with Bannister keeping us sombre
                  company to Meridian. Thereafter, it was one interminable nightmare of weariness,
                  dust, squalling children, overlaid with the sickening reek of orange peel, ham
                  sandwiches, and rancid clothes.</p>

               <head>The North Once More</head>
               <p>But even the longest journey ends. In the evening of a bitter,
                  blustery day the train rolled into the grey, familiar station, and there, in the
                  lee of the wind, stood my aunt, in her fur tippet and cap, solid as the Rock of
                  Gibraltar, and scarcely less formidable.</p>
               <p>She received us kindly, however, rushed us home, and, when we had
                  washed and changed to clean, though wrinkled, garments, she fed us a sensible,
                  nutritious meal. It can’t be said that joy abounded. None of us had much appetite,
                  though papa did his best to wax enthusiastic over the roast. Fresh meat was the
                  luxury in the south, said he, and thereby precipitated the storm. A nice mess we
                  had made of our lives! Now what in heaven’s name did papa intend to do? Quite
                  likely, he had been too immersed in his dream to read the papers intelligently,
                  and foresee what now had the country tied up in knots! Industrial panic! That’s
                  what it was! Jobs scarce as mercy, and here we were with nothing but the rags on
                  our backs!</p>
               <p>Maybe so, said papa, rallying for conscience’ sake. He was sure to
                  find something in the shop that had known him so long as a competent, reliable
                  worker. There was something to be said for skill, you know—to be sure, he’d find
                  something.</p>
               <p>From then on, the conversation disposed of us like sheep. We would
                  spend the night here together, but in the morning mamma and the younger children
                  were expected at Uncle Jacob’s. He had a large house now, not far from our old
                  home. Naturally, papa would remain with his sister for the time being. Nothing was
                  said of me. I might have been the Ghost of Christmas Past, for all the part I had
                  in the painful proceedings.</p>
               <p>What was to become of me, I wondered, as I peeled off my clothes in
                  a chilly slice of room that gave off the upper hallway. Why hadn’t I spoken up
                  myself, like a sensible being, instead of sitting there with the face of a mummy
                  and the indifference of the dead? Why was it so hard for me to express vital hopes
                  and fears, and so easy to say what was furthest from my earnest thought?</p>
               <p>Miserably, I told myself that unquestionably I should have to ask
                  my aunt to solve the riddle for me. Perhaps she had it solved now. Perhaps that
                  was why nothing had been said. She had helped so many strangers, done so much for
                  other nieces not particularly deserving. After all, what I wanted was not so very
                  much. A year in Normal. After that, how simply everything would adjust itself.</p>
               <p>Before I went to sleep I had almost convinced myself that such a
                  sensible procedure would appeal to my aunt. It was something of a body blow,
                  therefore, to have her transfix me with a cold glance at breakfast, saying:</p>
               <p>‘Well, young woman, you, of course, will go to work.’</p>
               <p>Yes, of course, I mumbled, glad of my shell; glad that the
                  sickening disappointment did not show in my empty face. Too occupied with the need
                  to hide my hurt even to wonder why she was so hard. Never suspecting, until years
                  later, that papa, doubtless anxious to prove that something had been gained by our
                  southern flight, had told her about Bannister. That I would be married in the
                  summer!</p>
               <p>Yet, had I known it, I question whether I should have explained
                  myself. I was too much like mamma, which, no doubt, was something else she held
                  against me. Bless her heart, she had her own fixed, iron pride. But a sensible
                  pride, not the chilling reserve that cannot even bend to lighten its own
                  discomfort.</p>
               <p>Somewhile later mamma called me to her room, where she was packing
                  the grips. She handed me two dollars—all the money she had—and her best black
                  skirt. I could make it over for myself at Uncle Jacob’s. It would make me look
                  older, and had a little warmth, besides. The next day I set off job hunting. It
                  seemed to me I trotted endless miles. No one wanted the services of an
                  inexperienced youngster.</p>
               <p>By noon I was half frozen, and hungry, and glum as a raven. The
                  Bon-Ton Bakery offered the warmth I needed, and I knew that hundreds of underpaid
                  clerks went there for soup and a bun at the lunch hour. How good it was to slip
                  into the hot little room smelling of fresh bread and teasing spices! How wonderful
                  to see, in the corner towards the back, Laura Johnson, the old, familiar,
                  half-quizzical frown on her pale, high forehead!</p>
               <p>‘For heaven’s sake!’ she greeted me. ‘What the dickens has
                  happened? You look awful!’</p>
               <p>Just the cold, I told her, and cowardice. I had no talent for
                  netting jobs. Well, I’d get nothing in the stores, she informed me, stirring her
                  soup viciously. Not a darn thing. Every last one of them had cut the staff,
                  whittled the wages, and handed the responsibility of starving clerks to the Lord
                  God Almighty! Fortunately, a few favoured souls still ate ice-cream. That was how
                  she came to be drinking soup and had a bed to sleep in.</p>
               <p>‘Gosh, L. G., and we are the smart little girls that had such Big
                  Ideas!’ she finished, glaring at a silver blonde who whisked by our table with a
                  sizzling steak. ‘See that? Now, there’s a wise virgin. But don’t ask me how she
                  buys a sirloin on three-fifty a week—you wouldn’t like the answer! Guess I’ll blow
                  you to a cream puff for the good of our souls.’</p>
               <p>Over the cream puffs we tried to push out of mind the spectre of
                  jobs, wintry weather, and virtue. Some of our old crowd had run to luck. Carl had
                  a splendid position, and Arne, whom I had bullied into attending night school, was
                  determined to go in for law. Minnie played the church organ like a wizard, led the
                  choir, and sang better than ever. If she had any sense she’d study singing.</p>
               <p>‘But she won’t,’ Laura sniffed. ‘She is too darn satisfied being
                  the shining light in the Lutheran church. That’s another funny thing, L.G., you
                  can kill yourself being satisfied.’</p>
               <p>Clarice, another confirmation classmate, was married, which put an
                  end to her fine chatter. Tilly had a job taking care of a couple of old people.
                  Nice change from babies.</p>
               <p>The lunch hour passed too quickly. I dreaded the thought of the
                  snowy streets and the thankless business before me. Wise with experience, Laura
                  tried to warn me. As we separated, she gripped my arm in the old affectionate
                  manner.</p>
               <p>‘See here, I know what you are up against. I know what a romantic
                  fool you are. Oh, don’t I remember the high-flown bunk you spilled over Tilly and
                  me! It’s so much birdseed in the wind, dearie. Not that I ever got the drift of
                  what you wanted, it was so mixed up with Jean Valjean and the Piece of String. Dam
                  fool stuff, used to make me roaring mad when I got home, where ma was grousing,
                  and the house stank of socks drying by the stove. Well, I’m warning you, those
                  fancy thoughts won’t save your shoes. When you reach the stage of cardboard
                  insoles, go to the Employment Bureau. They’ll get you a dear
                  little job, in somebody’s darling house!’</p>
               <p>Never! thought I, heading smartly into the wind. Even our leanest
                  days had not prepared me for such an eventuality. I’d rather pick rags and keep my
                  self-respect! Unfortunately for me, I had not been taught to accept poverty as an
                  act of God—as one’s portion, to be borne with humility. Mamma counted her
                  blessings not in terms of meekness and the World-to-Come, but in the strength of
                  inner fortitude, bequeathed by generations of self-respecting people. And
                  self-respect was synonymous with creditable deeds. How often had she intercepted
                  papa, riding the gale of some lofty sentiment:</p>
               <p>‘Oh, yes, you talk beautifully! But, to my way of thinking, the
                  ills of the world won’t be mended with tender sighs. I have no stomach for Pauline
                  doctrine!’</p>
               <p>Nor had I. ‘Servant, be obedient unto your masters, as unto the
                  Lord your God.’ What a glorious whip that had been in the hands of pious
                  exploiters! I had reached the stage where mamma’s practical wisdom overrode all
                  papa’s idealism. It would be years until I should see any possibility of
                  compromise between such extremes of opinion. At the moment, I could only see that,
                  in any crucial period it was mamma who saved the situation; mamma who exhibited
                  the virtues she thought it beneath dignity to frame in words.</p>
               <p>Yet the gist of her teaching summed up briefly. God was not
                  confined to creeds and a book. That was something to remember when confronted by
                  injustice enacted in His name. Right action sprang from a right heart. That was
                  something not to be forgotten when temptation urged you, against the decent
                  instincts bequeathed by your ancestors.</p>
               <p>Nice thought, that! Just how, I wondered amusedly, would the decent
                  instincts of dignitaries in ruffs and crosses conspire to solve the problems of a
                  green servant? The humour of it kept me insulated against the cold for a mile or
                  two; kept my benumbed feet marching smartly; stiffened my resolution, as place
                  after place gave me the same answer.</p>
               <p>At last, it seemed as though this determined prowling was to be
                  adequately rewarded. I was actually hired, by a fierce-looking little man, whose
                  topsy-turvy establishment was holding a three-day sale. Think of it, I was to be
                  privileged to flit up and down this dim lane of miscellaneous merchandise, where
                  socks and shirts and feather boas dangled from a clothes-line as gay as any
                  pennants of an ancient tourney. I really had a job—if only for three days. The
                  blissful knowledge sent me home on wings. An elation that was ill-founded,
                  however.</p>
               <p>I was sacked the next night. Not because I had failed to make the
                  sales. Oh, no, I had done rather well, as a matter of fact. But, in making out my
                  sales slip, I used the dollar sign and decimal point. This affectation I was
                  guileless enough to explain as something learned in school.</p>
               <p>‘In school! Abie, she thinks she’s in school!’ roared the irate
                  little man at the cash register.</p>
               <p>‘There’s nothing wrong with it,’ I tried to explain, which was an
                  even greater error.</p>
               <p>‘You should be telling me! Young lady, here we got us cent signs,
                  understand? Cent signs! Maybe you go back to school and learn some more monkey
                  business!’ my indignant employer shouted—and that was that.</p>
               <p>Oh well, there would be other sales, I told myself, as I pocketed
                  my dollar-fifty, and faced the dusky street. To-morrow was Sunday, and perhaps I
                  might visit the Rhinertsons and find Tilly there. To-morrow, I could be happy for
                  a few hours, at least. Mamma Rhinertson would be sure to have piles of potato
                  cakes and a fund of gossip with which to regale her visitors. And I had my letters
                  to write to Gordon Bannister.</p>
               <p>Sunday was a cheerful day. Tilly had not changed very much despite
                  her longer skirts and piled up hair. She had a better colour, but otherwise was
                  the same, self-effacing, smiling servant, flying about her multiple tasks:
                  whisking the house to rights, setting the table, making coffee, one eye always on
                  the little tots. She liked her work, she said. The old couple were very nice to
                  her, and she had a comfortable room to herself. Best of all, she could save her
                  wages, and one of these days she meant to buy a couple of stuffed chairs, and a
                  Brussels carpet for the front room.</p>
               <p>Going home that night I passed our old house, and stopped under the
                  big poplars where I had so often sat reading my books. It was queer, meeting the
                  yellow eyes of the old house this way—the eyes of a stranger, indifferent to my
                  wanderings. I had always hated its ugliness, but now it seemed to me that
                  something inseparable from the strong, stony hills at its back had put its mark on
                  that house. Something that had given me courage, and that I had not sufficiently
                  prized.</p>
               <p>I stole down to the creek bed, and listened to the old familiar
                  voice of the water, grumbling to itself under the pearl-grey ice. Suddenly my eyes
                  were wet. I had so loved the little brook. So loved the brown water that rode so
                  boldly over the shoulders of the hills. Now its brave voice reached me through a
                  shroud, unreal as the voice of a dream. That was it! The little brook had all my
                  fondest, fiercest dreams down there, under the cold, grey ice.</p>

               <head>Trials of a Job Hunter</head>
               <p>Came now the long, dreary days I would rather forget. Days measured
                  in aimless, endless tramping, through sleet and snow, frigid winds, and sub-zero
                  weather. Each morning forcing myself to believe that to-day the miracle would
                  happen. To-day, all prayers would be answered. To-day, I should find a job. An
                  old, old experience, to which every one is thoroughly indifferent, except the
                  wretched novice in the economic scramble.</p>
               <p>Not a pleasant, or particularly elevating experience, yet to be
                  highly recommended as initial training for the righteous snobs who play at
                  redeeming mankind. It instils lasting pity for the slattern and the beer-bibber.
                  It so quickly reduces all high-flown necessities to the common denominator of
                  shoes and soup. It bares the bleak bones of mutual dependence as nothing else can.
                  For the painful side of this begging is not its direct effect upon yourself. It is
                  the coming back to those who wait upon your success or failure. I came to loath
                  the last block home. It was torture to sit down to supper, where I felt a burden,
                  and thought all eyes condemned me.</p>
               <p>Down to the last quarter, I pocketed pride, and bolted to the
                  Employment Bureau. Yes, there was a job I might try. Mrs. H. on Third Street East
                  wanted a second girl. The wage was small, but the work easy. The house was one of
                  those three-story, brown-stone buildings popular in those days. It seemed a
                  prison. I thought I should never muster up the courage to approach the dark
                  door.</p>
               <p>A small, sharp-featured woman in black answered the bell, eyed me
                  coldly, and told me to go up a flight of stairs, turn right at the second chamber.
                  Mrs. H. was not very well, and was still in bed.</p>
               <p>Mrs. H. was not the least terrifying. From her mount of pillows and
                  eiderdown she smiled genially, and her voice had the soft, unmistakable slur of
                  the south. She had no objection to my inexperience, which I freely admitted. The
                  work was not the least difficult. I was to notify Hattie—the prim woman in
                  black—that I was hired. Hattie would make a place for me in her room, and explain
                  my duties thoroughly.</p>
               <p>No doubt a sensible, pious soul should have rejoiced, grateful in
                  every hair that board and bed was forthcoming. On the contrary, I could have
                  howled with misery. To my jaundiced thinking, this was the end of everything.
                  Laura J. was right—high-flown thinking got you just exactly nothing.</p>
               <p>For girls like us the dice were loaded from the start. The ensign
                  of the mop and the dustbin hung over our cradles. No wonder thousands of us
                  married any old fool! Bed and board! Was that the answer? Was that all of life?
                  Was there no room in this iron world for the quickened sensibilities? For the
                  white fire that raced along the edges of the mind at the beautiful, swift soaring
                  of a bird? No meaning to the strange, insistent yearning for a deeper fulfilment
                  of purposes? Just to eat and sleep, propagate your misery, and die!</p>
               <p>By the time I scaled the hill to my uncle’s house I was in a pretty
                  dither. Mamma, seemingly, understood what ailed me, and applied the pertinent
                  remedy. She did not, as papa might have done, launch into a moving lamentation
                  about the mischief of poverty; the necessity to support with courage the slings
                  and arrows of outrageous fortune. Somewhat grimly, she watched me dourly packing
                  my few belongings, then she said:</p>
               <p>‘There is one thing left. One precious thing. Keep yourself to
                  yourself. To those people, you are nothing but the means to get things done. Do it
                  well—but keep yourself to yourself.’</p>
               <p>At any rate, now I should see how the folk on the right side of
                  town moved and had their being. That was something by way of interest and
                  compensation. As a matter of fact, there were many compensations. Mrs. H. was an
                  easy-going individual, seldom fault-finding, and never unjustly. Following mamma’s
                  advice, I effaced myself so much as possible, and followed Hattie’s instructions
                  to the best of my ability. Fortunately, I never found it hard to employ my hands,
                  no matter where my thought wandered. There was plenty to do, with three floors to
                  keep clean. Seven bedrooms, carpeted to the baseboard in the good, Victorian
                  style, all to be swept with a broom, the vacuum-cleaner being yet unborn. Two
                  master bedrooms, with lounges attached, filled with a clutter of heavy furniture,
                  heavy drapes, stuffed cushions, and dust-collecting knick-knacks.</p>
               <p>Only two floors had bathrooms, which meant that water must be
                  lugged to the top floor. I had charge of the linen, and must remember that some of
                  the family abhorred soft towels, and others swooned at the sight of anything
                  harsh. One of the rooms was occupied by a friend of the family, a member of a law
                  firm and son of a senator then at Washington; a very dainty gentleman, whose bed
                  must be made with extreme care.</p>
               <p>His stomach was as pernickety as his hide, and Hattie had always to
                  concoct especially mild dishes for his sustenance. It used to amuse me that this
                  six-foot American masterpiece suffered insomnia from a wrinkle in the sheets, and
                  indigestion from a whisp of steak. I hasten to add that, on high occasions, when
                  the social obligations so demanded, the gentleman laid down his comfort for the
                  sake of his country, and ate anything from oysters to nuts.</p>
               <p>Hattie was not given to conversation. For several days she scarcely
                  spoke, except to direct the work, and heaven help me if I failed to understand,
                  for nothing short of the Archangel Gabriel could have induced her to repeat
                  herself. Even that first awful night, when I crept upstairs, too miserable to
                  sleep, she calmly said her prayers to the whisper of her rosary, climbed into bed,
                  and, without a word, turned out the light, leaving me to my moping by the
                  window.</p>
               <p>Oh well, there were the stars. Bright and clear, and far removed
                  from human flurries. If I cried myself to sleep, there was no one to see; no one
                  to hear; which was just as well. Neither Hattie nor any one else could have
                  comforted that young creature by the window. Nor did she herself understand the
                  exact source of her exaggerated misery, or why she was suddenly more afraid of
                  losing touch with the stars than of anything tangible and real.</p>

               <head>Readjustment and the Righteous Few</head>
               <p>I had served a tolerable apprenticeship. I could be trusted with
                  the beds, trusted not to rattle the cutlery, or spill the soup down sensitive
                  backs; I could even be trusted with madam’s breakfast tray. All of which, to
                  Hattie’s way of thinking, argued that now I might also be trusted with the family
                  honour and glory.</p>
               <p>Hattie had been with the family for eighteen years, which in itself
                  spoke volumes for their indubitable superiority. Hattie was not merely a jewel of
                  a cook, but a flawless pearl of rectitude. Saint Peter himself would hesitate to
                  question the credentials of her favourites. Well, her family,
                  though not rich, had something of which to be proud.</p>
               <p>Mr. H., a notable lawyer, was a Virginian. The eldest son was
                  attending the University of Virginia, as had all the eldest sons for generations.
                  The second son was at some military college, and I gathered from the sudden
                  fluster of Hattie’s manner as she pummelled her piecrust that Master Jim had need
                  of discipline. The two daughters, she felt sure, must have impressed me with their
                  exceptional promise of beauty. Madge was a dashing brunette, and Vera such a
                  demure little blonde! A lazy baggage, I would have said, and fat besides! Of
                  madam, no need to speak, said Hattie. I must have judged for myself what a
                  splendid woman she was.</p>
               <p>So I had, and had long since suspected what Hattie’s loyalty sought
                  to suppress. Amiable Mrs. H., with her feline sensuality and self-complacent
                  comfort, was not quite the social equal of her saturnine spouse, whose ancestors
                  may well have snooted peg-legged Stuyvesant, with his cow and cabbages and petty
                  leases in New Amsterdam. According to Hattie’s conviction, it was my solemn duty
                  to be thoroughly grateful for the privilege of standing in the shadow of the
                  Lord’s elect. She had no doubt I was properly impressed.</p>
               <p>How scandalized she would have been to read my thoughts! How shaken
                  to the roots of her religious soul to know that every beautiful thing in that
                  house intensified my resentment against the cruel inequalities of life. It was not
                  that I coveted any of these domestic trappings. Things in themselves meant little
                  to me, for all my yearning centred in the world of books. It was the atmosphere
                  these things created, the sense of security and well-being, that made gracious
                  living a matter of course. It was the contrast of this home as against Laura’s
                  dead dwelling that set me thinking. Laura had brains and ability and a burning
                  desire to better herself. To what good? She was starving in a cheap little room,
                  for the sake of peace! Exaggeration? Well, I wondered how Miss Vera would manage
                  her placid graces on ten dollars a month, six of which went for a bed, a patch of
                  hall carpet, and a pine bureau! I wondered then, as I wonder now, how the fine
                  moralists expect a girl to feed and clothe herself on ten dollars a month, in
                  honour!</p>
               <p>I love the picture the assembled family made at dinner, every one
                  self-assured, even in displeasure, all so beautifully groomed. I admired the
                  picture, but often enough, as I cleared away half-eaten food, I had a fleeting
                  vision of the Rhinertson children watching with big eyes as the plate of potato
                  bread went around. I used to see, against my will, thousands of similar tables,
                  where the so-called respectable poor stoked their bellies with meagre, starchy
                  fare, and, in spite of clinging faith, I was revolted. There was something
                  terribly wrong in attributing such contrasts to the dispensation of the Almighty
                  Providence. Something blasphemous in preaching a religion that laid such evils on
                  the shoulders of God. Not so long as I had wit to judge for myself of the
                  boundless riches of the earth should I be persuaded to believe that these natural
                  resources were solely designed for the enjoyment of the few who invested their
                  money, which, without the labour of the disinherited, would have been as worthless
                  as charity.</p>
               <p>Solemn sermons on the merits of thrift and virtue and wisdom should
                  not alter my conviction that these things were wrong and iniquitous. None of these
                  excellent qualities are the fruits of poverty. Even to practise the thrift of a
                  squirrel requires a surplus over and above the meanest needs of the body. But
                  neither the squirrel nor the prosperous individual knows anything about the
                  vicious sort of thrift to which the very poor are shackled more ignominiously than
                  was any African in irons.</p>
               <p>In a vague, tormented fashion, these things simmered in my mind as
                  I slipped about with choice cheese, fruits, coloured ices: foods I had not known
                  to exist. Yet, how fortunate I had been compared to many! And these people thought
                  themselves cruelly pinched. As they doubtless were, compared with the wealthy
                  clique in Lakeside.</p>
               <p>These rambling resentments did not affect my interest in the
                  family. Mrs. H. was kind, as many indolent people are kind, chiefly because it
                  administers to their own comfort not to disturb the status quo.
                  She did nothing from morning till night, and accomplished it perfectly. She was
                  never bored, seldom irritable, and rarely ever sorry for herself.</p>
               <p>At nine-thirty I brought up her breakfast, for which she had a good
                  appetite; which amazed me, who hate the sight of food at that hour. For the rest
                  of the morning she played with her complexion, her hair, her fingernails. Failing
                  an engagement after lunch, she occupied first one soft chair, then another, toying
                  with a book or a piece of embroidery. The same books lay on the table when I left,
                  three months later, that were there on my arrival; the same piece of needlework
                  beside them. What her thoughts were, only heaven knows.</p>
               <p>She had the virtues of the lazy. She never questioned the progress
                  of our work. If Hattie was satisfied with my efforts, that was all she cared
                  about. She made a point of inquiring after our comfort. She had heard me coughing
                  in the night, and wished to be sure that nothing serious ailed me. I was thin, she
                  thought. Perhaps I didn’t eat enough. One morning she told me to sit down. She had
                  been watching me, she said, and had decided that I was not the sort of girl who
                  usually applied for housework. Why had I not thought of something better? I had a
                  nice voice, a quiet manner, and I spoke very well indeed.</p>
               <p>That shops were not hiring help astonished her. How queer! People
                  still bought things, and prices were outrageous. Only yesterday she had paid
                  seventeen dollars for four little doilies. They were not worth it, but when your
                  finances were embarrassed, you had to put up with inferior stuffs. Why hadn’t I
                  kept on at school, if things were so difficult in stores and offices?</p>
               <p>I had no desire to dramatize the situation. But, I admitted how
                  much I had wanted to attend Normal; that for the present it was impossible, since
                  I had neither home nor other means of livelihood. How unfortunate! Well, in the
                  spring, everything would improve. Business always picked up in the spring, for
                  some reason or other. Meanwhile, she would ask her dressmaker and the milliner if
                  there wasn’t an opening. It must be fun trimming hats—and so respectable. Then,
                  which was very kind, she handed me a book, and told me I might read whatever I
                  liked in the evening.</p>
               <p>Mr. H. seemed little more than a dignified figurehead in the house,
                  coming and going about his business in grave, absorbed silence; asking nothing;
                  saying nothing. Now and then he brought home a gift of flowers for his wife. The
                  girls were good-natured and amiable, like their mother: troubled with nothing
                  except clothes, skating parties, and sorority dances. They lived in a world
                  distant as the moon.</p>
               <p>For the most part, I gave little thought to any of them. I had my
                  own problem to solve. On my day out I felt like a thief, stealing into the street
                  from the narrow back alley, and thought I must surely die if, by some mischance, a
                  former friend saw me. I still had all my vanity intact. That Tilly and Laura
                  should know of my predicament did not matter, but the thought of meeting Carl, or
                  Arne, or fortunate Mollie of boarding-school glamour turned me faint with shame.
                  Then there were my letters from Bannister—dear, charming letters, that made me
                  feel a horrid impostor. Impossible to believe that the queer creature who lived by
                  grace of mop and broom had any right to these pages! And it scared me to death,
                  being constantly reminded that not later than July he was coming to Duluth.</p>
               <p>That must not be! Until I was out of the mess, and had some sort of
                  home in which to receive him, he must not come! Not for all the romance of earth
                  would I meet any man at a kitchen door! Fool or not, I had not sufficient faith in
                  male affection to believe that it could survive the shock of meeting the object of
                  its dream attired in a cotton uniform, and popping out of an alley!</p>
               <p>Perhaps I did not want it so. To love me was to love my pride. What
                  a headache it was! What endless hours of frantic worry it created. The prospect of
                  a home was still a misty vision. Papa had temporary employment, and was planning a
                  lecture trip through the Icelandic settlements of Manitoba when the job was done.
                  He had some hope of locating something better in Canada, which seemed less
                  affected by the general depression.</p>
               <p>Mamma was hoarding the pennies. She was the proud owner of two
                  chairs and a kitchen table. In a month, she hoped to buy a stove. So far, my
                  contribution was only the payment of the two dollars squandered in job hunting.
                  The most sainted thrift falls short on three dollars a week. Out of my first
                  week’s salary (bless the word!) I had to pay the employment bureau, and buy blue
                  percale for two dresses. I would look so nice in blue, Mrs. H. thought. I was much
                  too young to go about in a black skirt and blouse.</p>
               <p>A pair of shoes ate up the next week’s earnings, then I paid my
                  debt, and now I had only to wait six weeks to get a spring coat. All providing the
                  devil did not tempt me to think of a hat, or some wickedness like a lace collar,
                  or the book of Aldrich’s poems, marked down to twenty-five cents in a near-by shop
                  window.</p>
               <p>Satan won, to the extent of the poems, I am glad to say. Virtue has
                  brought me such small comfort. The little book was an oasis of joy in the dull
                  monotony of stupid housework. For everything about housework is a stupid
                  repetition, with the exception of cooking. The book of verse, and Hattie expertly
                  assembling a beautiful meal, were the highlights of existence. Hattie’s cooking
                  was a fine art; not an idle gesture, not a single, superfluous spoon cluttered the
                  table. Everything was accomplished with ease and dispatch. Because I watched her
                  intently, asking no worrisome questions, she tossed off a priceless hint now and
                  then which I tucked away in the crannies of my mind. Many years later, when I had
                  to feed thirteen pernickety boarders, I had reason to bless Hattie, and be
                  grateful for a memory that retains and easily calls forth whatever it really fixes
                  upon.</p>

               <head>A Kitchen-View of Society</head>
               <p>Three unrelated incidents of those otherwise uneventful months
                  stand out in my mind. Not that they were spectacular, or of particular interest in
                  themselves, except as they sharpened my understanding of certain mental concepts
                  that form an impressive guard between the sheep and the goats.</p>
               <p>Mrs. H. informed us one morning that she was expecting a house
                  guest: a very dear friend. There would be no fuss. A dinner and a tea, perhaps.
                  Nothing elaborate, for the lady was unwell, and desired a quiet rest. The visitor
                  arrived next day, and to my astonishment, for I had been anticipating a delicate,
                  dainty female, the lady looked about as fragile as a mountain lion. Tall, stout,
                  with a square, though not unhandsome face, she was anything but the type one
                  associates with condiments and cushions. Yet, within the hour, this heroic bulk,
                  eased of its stays, was gracelessly overflowing the softest arm-chair in madam’s
                  lounge.</p>
               <p>Then it was, against intent and inclination, that I overheard an
                  illuminating shred of dialogue. Entering with a tea-tray it was impossible not to
                  hear the delicious chatter:</p>
               <p>‘Of course, it’s impossible at your age, Edith. You couldn’t be
                  expected to submit to such a thing, darling!’ This from Mrs. H.</p>
               <p>‘I certainly cannot. A baby would be too ridiculous!’ the lioness
                  rumbled.</p>
               <p>At which awkward moment I perforce set down the tray! Bless their
                  buttons, I dare say neither one thought I had sense enough to follow such erudite
                  reasoning. I can’t say that I was shocked. Long since, I had reached the
                  conclusion that accidental and undesired parenthood was no great blessing. That
                  this square-faced Amazon rebelled, albeit tardily, at the beautiful boon of Eve,
                  was not so startling. I had heard a deal of grumbling in the hospital. What sent a
                  wave of hot resentment from head to heel was the quick realization that in her
                  case the attitude was accepted as eminently practical.</p>
               <p>I remembered a rag of a girl, pleading vainly for help in a similar
                  situation. How horrible that was! How wretchedly sinful! The folly in either case
                  is beside the point. What struck me like a blow was the obvious injustice of a
                  society which exacts the letter of the law only from the less fortunate.</p>
               <p>The incident had its humorous aspect. Next morning Mistress Edith
                  hasted away on her pertinent mission, and shortly thereafter returned in a
                  somewhat shattered state. The bell screaming shrilly, up I flew, hot-footed, to
                  the lady’s chamber. What a sight to see! A helpless giantess in distress, the poor
                  woman, half stripped, stood amid the clutter of discarded garments, tearing at her
                  corset with shaking fingers.</p>
               <p>‘For God’s sake, help me out of this,’ she yelped, ‘I’m dying. I’m
                  dead!—I’ve got to get a cup of tea!’</p>
               <p>Easier said than done! However, at the cost of great groaning,
                  frantic fumbling, and desperate hauling on miles of laces, the feat was finally
                  accomplished, and the victim tucked into bed.</p>
               <p>The rest of the day devolved into a marathon between the kitchen,
                  where I was helping Hattie prepare for a formal dinner, and the bedroom, where I
                  supported the guest of honour towards a better lease of life.</p>
               <p>The dinner was set for eight o’clock. Little dreaming the fortitude
                  of socially ambitious females, I kept wondering how the patient expected to attend
                  her own party. At seven the bell rang peremptorily, and off I bounced, to receive
                  yet another enlightening shock.</p>
               <p>Draped in a blue wrapper, Mistress Edith was up, seated at the
                  dressing-table, calmly applying blobs of cream. On the bed lay a bell-shaped moiré
                  underslip and a shimmering, white satin Princess dress. Beside these the wicked
                  corset, with its multiple straps, clasps, and strings, looked a fearsome
                  strait-jacket.</p>
               <p>I could guess the pleasant job before me. What hectic pinching,
                  pulling, and alarming breath-holdings it required to jockey the unruly flesh into
                  proper mould. How the wicked laughter chortled in me as the fat rolled up under
                  the thick, unlovely arms, and down upon the heavy thighs in order to achieve the
                  fashionable wasp waist which, presumably, gladdened appreciative male eyes.</p>
               <p>Then, panting but triumphant, on with the moiré slip; on with cream
                  and powder and perfume; on with the resplendent gown, fortified with whalebone and
                  its thousand and one safeguarding hooks and eyelets.</p>
               <p>At eight o’clock the lady swept down the winding stairs, three-foot
                  train rustling majestically, and the saints alone knew at what cost she stepped so
                  lightly, laughed so blithely, in response to the greeting of the gentleman who led
                  her in to dinner.</p>
               <p>Throughout the many courses Mistress Edith maintained her gaiety,
                  which, happily, hid her total lack of appetite. The following day she spent in
                  bed. The cold had settled on her chest, you understand. When she finally took her
                  joyous departure she generously presented me with a fifty-cent ribbon for my
                  hair—which I ungenerously dropped in the ash-bin.</p>
               <p>Shortly hereafter, I inferred from Hattie’s apologetic murmur that
                  the younger son of the house was coming home to digest some indiscretion. As not
                  infrequently happens, he was his mother’s idol, and Hattie implored the Holy
                  Saints to smooth the way of the transgressor. It would be so terrible for madam if
                  the father were too harsh.</p>
               <p>Nothing daunted, the young man arrived, and, apparently, had no
                  difficulty in squaring himself with his parents. Certainly Mrs. H. glowed with
                  pleasure to have him home, fluttering and fussing over the darling boy’s every
                  whim and foible. For several days he behaved with admirable docility, perpetrating
                  no greater mischief than driving his sisters into abortive rages.</p>
               <p>Then, one afternoon, as I was pottering about the second floor, I
                  heard the vestibule door below open with a crash, and, simultaneously, the sound
                  of some heavy object striking against a chair; a smothered yelp of pain, then
                  uneasy steps on the stairs.</p>
               <p>It was Master Jim—a very groggy Jim—listing windward, a nasty,
                  greenish pallor in his youthful face. Catching sight of me, at the stair head, the
                  gallant waved a cheery fin, but the effort of supporting both equilibrium and
                  charm was disastrous. The poor thing clutched his midriff and, with a brave bound
                  concluding the stairs, dived for the bathroom.</p>
               <p>Mrs. H., enjoying a pleasant nap, had rudely wakened. What was that
                  noise, she demanded irritably, though unsuspicious. What on earth had I done out
                  there, making such a clatter? To which I answered nothing, trusting that indolence
                  would outbid curiosity, and the scapegrace find cover before his mother aroused
                  sufficiently to quit her easy couch.</p>
               <p>Which he did, though by so mean a margin I had barely time to
                  obliterate the stains of iniquity. Mrs. H., accusative and cross, confronted me as
                  I emerged from the bathroom.</p>
               <p>‘What is going on——’ she began, and faltered
                  uneasily as a malodorous whiff struck her offended nostrils. Something bordering
                  on consternation showed in her face for a fleeting moment, then she broke out
                  crossly: ‘What was that—that noise?’</p>
               <p>‘Was there a noise, madam?’ said I, no muttonhead more dumb.</p>
               <p>‘Of course there was a noise! It woke me,’ she carped, obviously on
                  the horns of a dilemma, wanting the truth, and fearing the confirmation of her
                  suspicions.</p>
               <p>‘I was putting the linen away. The door often slams,’ I offered,
                  which was true—up to a point.</p>
               <p>Whatever she may have thought, it went unspoken, for suddenly she
                  remembered the gentleman with senatorial connections.</p>
               <p>‘Mr. K. will be here any minute! And the wretched drains are
                  smelling!’ she gasped. ‘For goodness’ sake, open the window, and ask Hattie what
                  to do!’</p>
               <p>The episode had its anticlimax some days later. It happened I was
                  hurrying down the same stairs, and found my way barred by gallant Mr. Jim.</p>
               <p>‘See here, can’t you be a bit friendly to a loving young man?’ he
                  demanded, wearing his most fetching expression. ‘You can’t be such an icicle,’ he
                  pursued, improving upon invention in fine, histrionic style.</p>
               <p>Oh well, a sturdy, bovine stare is more effective than a million
                  words. The loving creature dropped his arms, and off I went about my business.
                  Keeping myself to myself. So far as I was personally concerned, the incident had
                  no significance. I had no taste for backstair flirtation, and lacked the vanity
                  either to be flattered or insulted. I simply chalked up another score against a
                  class which has such scant respect for the sensibilities of those whom ill
                  circumstances confine to humble service.</p>
               <p>I had my own, specific temptations, less easily dismissed.
                  Sometimes I spent my Sunday with Laura in the tantalizing folly of window
                  shopping. Spring was almost upon us, and everywhere a hundred pretty garments
                  teased our eyes. There were so many things we needed, so many more we should have
                  been delighted to wear.</p>
               <p>In the case of myself, none of this was so urgent. But for Laura,
                  who was expected to look smart, the situation was distressing. Yet how distressing
                  I was not to understand for several months. That she was pale and nervous, so that
                  the slightest noise made her jump, I could see, and I had the uncomfortable
                  feeling that to dress herself she went without food. And she was always
                  fastidiously clean, which meant that, however hungry she was, the laundry had to
                  be paid.</p>
               <p>She suffered from loneliness, too, for, unlike myself, she had no
                  interest in books. It made her jumpy trying to read after working hours. It made
                  her boiling mad to follow the impossible successes of the bright mortals spun out
                  of the heads of comfortable nitwits who thought that life was an angel cake. And
                  the stuff I mooned over gave her the jitters. Imagine getting a kick out of The Laughing Man!</p>
               <p>But when she saw me wistfully eyeing a wine-coloured suit in
                  Freeman’s window, she understood me. It was exactly the sort of thing I should
                  wear. It would go so well with my dark brown hair and show to advantage my only
                  attribute, a very decent figure.</p>
               <p>I had not thought of the tempting thing in just those terms. I
                  simply pined for it as I never before nor since pined for any scrap of ornament.
                  It seemed to me that its mere possession would clothe me with magical virtues, and
                  restore all my battered self-respect.</p>
               <p>For three nights running I stole out after dark, just to look at
                  it. And then I received a letter from Bannister that tried me sorely.</p>
               <p>Said he, in effect, that I should remember that, whatever he had,
                  it was mine for the asking. That he imagined things were not too easy for us, that
                  he wished I would have faith enough to let him help me.</p>
               <p>Dear goodness! With the letter in my pocket I marched to that
                  window once more. I could have that precious thing. It was mine, for just a word
                  or two. Why not? Surely that was the sensible procedure. Yes, I would do it! I
                  would go straight up to that attic room and write the letter——</p>
               <p>But when I had the pen and paper before me I froze with shame. I
                  sat there, staring at the slanting walls, seeing for the first time quite clearly
                  what I must write. Something sharp and final, that put an end to all these devoted
                  letters. And that something must effectively break Bannister’s idealized image of
                  me.</p>
               <p>Well, I had always some gift of words, when it came to putting them
                  on paper. I wrote my letter, and promptly mailed it. Then I took a farewell squint
                  at my precious suit, and scampered home to cry myself to sleep. By return mail, I
                  received a cryptic note. Three short, angry lines. He was leaving for the north,
                  May 13th. He would not see me; and ending:</p>
               <p>‘We Bannisters keep our word.’</p>
               <p>That night I took a long walk up into the hills, where the dark lay
                  thick, and the heavy silence, full of healing wisdom, quieted the ache in my
                  troubled mind.</p>
               <p>A few days later the last of the three illuminating incidents to
                  which I referred leaped at me like an angry cur. The eldest son had come home for
                  the Easter holidays. He was a humourless prig, filled with his own importance: as
                  certain of success as fools were sure to give it. I had been dusting out his room,
                  and, perhaps an hour later, was peremptorily hauled upon the mat.</p>
               <p>He had left a cheque on his desk. It was gone. What had I done with
                  it? There was no use lying. No use stealing it, either. It would do me no
                  good.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the decent instincts of the ancestors did support me then.
                  At any rate, I had the grace to say little, and say it calmly. It was he who raged
                  in undiluted, proletarian fervour, ripping through papers like a whirlwind, and
                  bringing his mother on the jump by the precious clamour.</p>
               <p>Kind soul, she was distressed. I was free to go on with my work;
                  she would help Master Jack find the cheque. No doubt it was merely mislaid.</p>
               <p>It was found in the book he had been reading. Mrs. H. came to tell
                  me the glad tidings. She was sorry: she hoped I had not taken the little storm to
                  heart. One had to be careful with money.</p>
               <p>I was cleaning the silver, and kept on cleaning it. To be called a
                  thief is not exactly pleasant, but it has its sharp merit. It jogs your little
                  ego: makes you see very clearly what the poor really look like to the respectable
                  people who save the heathen and pack such lovely Christmas hampers.</p>
               <p>Not long thereafter Mrs. H. decided to dispense with the services
                  of a second girl. The sons had gone about their business, her daughters would soon
                  be leaving, on their summer holiday, and she herself was thinking of a trip east.
                  Hattie could manage by herself, but now she wanted me to realize how pleased she
                  had been with my behaviour. If I could find the books, I was welcome to come back
                  in the fall and work for my board while I attended Normal School.</p>
               <p>What was more, she had a job for me. Mrs. C., a connexion by
                  marriage, was going to Chicago for an audience with a famous singing teacher. She
                  expected to remain for two or three months, and wanted some trustworthy girl to
                  take charge of her little daughter, Bea. Mrs. C. was—well—a trifle exacting and
                  temperamental, which was to be expected of an artist, but it would quite likely
                  prove an easy place once she had left. There seemed nothing else to do. Business
                  was still just as slack in the stores, and the only hope on the horizon was the
                  promise of a job at Kugler’s drug store, where Laura worked, when the fountain
                  trade picked up. Until then, I might as well turn nursemaid.</p>
               <p>The new household was a revelation. Mr. C. was an eminent
                  eye-ear-nose-and-throat specialist. A dry stick of a man, years older than his
                  india-rubber wife, with the coldest voice and eye that ever I encountered. The
                  very first morning he fixed me with a microscopic glance, hoped I had a shred of
                  sense, and would see to it that not a drop of water got into Bea’s ears.</p>
               <p>‘Wipe them with a dry towel—a dry towel, do you
                  understand?’</p>
               <p>The lady rattled off the rest of the instructions, standing at a
                  safe distance, as though afraid of contamination. She never passed either the cook
                  or me without pinching back her skirts. Nominally, I was supposed to watch young
                  Bea, but until the lady’s departure I might as well make myself useful, doing the
                  upstairs work, waiting table, and wiping the dishes.</p>
               <p>Quite a chore, since there were seven ill-assorted individuals in
                  the house: a crotchety doctor; his tempestuous wife; an infant of three; and, in
                  addition, the lady’s widowed brother-in-law and his three half-grown children. It
                  certainly gave promise of more than interest! The house looked like a junk shop
                  above stairs. In every conceivable nook and cranny were dismantled beds, antique
                  chests, high-boys, and tables, all yelling for dusting. These treasures, I learned
                  from cook, were being purchased to furnish the grand new home the doctor was
                  building in Lakeside. A home to properly house this lady, and hold her voice.</p>
               <p>Cook had other things less complimentary to tell. Mrs. C. was so
                  mean she counted the eggs every morning! She peered into the tea canister, the
                  sugar-bin, and the bread-box, and never in the three months that Annie had been
                  there, had she tasted a chop, or a sliver of steak. Madam ordered exactly seven
                  pieces, and then carped about the shrinkage.</p>
               <p>All of which was perfectly true. We were lucky to get a scraping of
                  vegetables and left-over bread. One night, there was a delicious row over the
                  number of potatoes required for a creamed dish. Annie insisted upon four. Madam
                  decided that two large ones were quite sufficient.</p>
               <p>‘What!’ croaked cook, mournful as Hamlet’s ghost. ‘Two potatoes for
                  nine people?’</p>
               <p>Which was no way to speak. There were only seven people—and two
                  servants. But this little scrimmage was nothing compared with the comedy of a
                  later night.</p>
               <p>All that day madam had regaled the angels with soaring rhapsodies,
                  and not for her soul’s sake would cook have dared intrude with questions of food.
                  Consequently when the family sat down to dinner, it consisted of a meagre blob of
                  salt cod, riding the crest of an immense platter, and a tray of brown bread.</p>
               <p>What a feast of joy that was! Dr. C. glared at me with his
                  microscopic orbs. Well, was that all? What was I standing about for—where were the
                  vegetables?</p>
               <p>Sweet as the Paschal Lamb, I said there were none.</p>
               <p>What, roars he, and why not? And, to my unholy glee, he ramps into
                  battle with the undaunted prima donna.</p>
               <p>‘Gertrude, what’s the matter with you?’ demands he. ‘Have you lost
                  your senses? Do you expect me to put up with this—this beastly mess!’ And more of
                  the kind.</p>
               <p>To which the great lady replied by blaming the cook. This was the
                  sort of thing that happened, if one trusted to the intelligence of menials. Annie
                  was such a fool.</p>
               <p>He would see about that, replied the master, and forthwith, bounced
                  up from the table and out into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>But Annie, cheerfully swishing out the solitary pot, simply waved
                  her hand towards the pantry.</p>
               <p>‘Have a look for yourself, Dr. C.,’ said she.</p>
               <p>The shelves yielded a bag of prunes, and nothing else.</p>
               <p>‘Damnation!’ muttered the indignant lord, grabbing a fistful, by
                  way of ammunition for the final round with his wife.</p>
               <p>After that, the vegetable bin was never empty, although everything
                  else was whittled to the nicest fraction. But now I was to see the shining side of
                  all this stupendous thrift.</p>
               <p>Madam gave a dinner to celebrate her forthcoming departure, and to
                  properly impress a well-chosen few. Food poured into the house like an avalanche.
                  From morning until night, Annie and I struggled with an incredible variety of
                  greens, shell-fish, chicken, ham, plain and fancy vegetables, condiments, ices,
                  and small cakes. Boning crab, blanching almonds, stuffing dates, to say nothing of
                  preparing hors-d’œuvres, kept us hot and hopping.</p>
               <p>By nine o’clock I had served this feast of fat things to the joyous
                  crowd, for, of course, as madam explained, there was no sense hiring a waitress
                  when I had proven myself so apt at my former place. In a white dress, borrowed
                  from Cook, who, fortunately, was a small, trim Swede, I should look well
                  enough.</p>
               <p>The kitchen was a sight to see, with dishes and glassware and
                  tumbled food stacked in every conceivable corner, even under the table. It was one
                  o’clock before the mess was cleared away, and we small fry had a cup of coffee and
                  a chicken sandwich.</p>
               <p>It was the following week that Mrs. C. took me to task for
                  inefficiency. There was no reason for wasting an hour on the upstairs. Why, she
                  herself could make all the beds, dust, and sweep, in half the time. It was
                  scandalous. Bea must get out into the sunlight. Unless I improved, she would
                  hesitate to leave the baby in my care. To put it bluntly, I was not earning my
                  wages.</p>
               <p>‘Very well,’ said I, quite calmly, ‘in that case, I shall not take
                  it.’ And, much to the dear lady’s indignation, away I went.</p>

               <p>Kugler’s would not take me for another month, but I put in six
                  weeks working for a jovial Norwegian woman who ran the Lakeside pavilion and
                  dance-hall. The season was not started, although there was plenty to do; but, as
                  Mrs. Gunderson was as amiable as she was frankly fat, the work was a pleasure.</p>
               <p>It was fun, watching the rolling gait of her walk, and the agility
                  of her huge, red arms beating up immense cake batters. Always fond of cooking, the
                  family dinner fell to my lot, and that was a nice change from sliding about with a
                  duster.</p>
               <p>An occasional dance stepped up the trade, and added to interest. It
                  amused me to watch the proletariat having a fling at fifty cents a couple.</p>
               <p>The following month mamma moved into a tiny little house, far back
                  in the hills: three small rooms, with a wide, secluded meadow for a yard. Not
                  much, yet how glad we were to be under a roof of our own! So now I had a bed at
                  home, and, shortly thereafter, was busily serving the dear public with ice-cream
                  sodas, sundaes, and what-not. It was wonderful, feeling free! Wonderful, working
                  with Laura! Wonderful, being roared at by a fussy Greek, who never meant a single
                  word of his angry abuse.</p>
               <p>A new sort of life unrolled itself before me. A sort of pageant of
                  gay pretence: little stenographers playing at being ladies, flirted bravely over
                  mounds of sickly stuff; frizzled sales girls stomped in with the boy friends after
                  the show; middle-aged housewives eased themselves from shopping, and placated
                  their cranky youngsters with five-cent blobs of vanilla. Not infrequently, some
                  sour-looking gentleman crept in on his way to work to ask Tony for something to
                  settle a rampaging stomach.</p>
               <p>There were acres of offices over our heads, and some of the medical
                  men had a habit of dropping in for Coca-Cola and a bit of badinage with us girls.
                  One incorrigible old duffer, whom I had met at my aunt’s hospital, delighted to
                  plague me by hauling on his rubber gloves when his glass was drained:</p>
               <p>‘So now to visit my gallant ladies,’ he would twinkle. Said gallant
                  ladies being housed on the waterfront behind us.</p>
               <p>There was a young dentist who always raised our temperatures, a
                  really beautiful creature: clean-limbed, shapely, suave, with not a care in the
                  world, that we could imagine. He was always fascinatingly gay, and almost broke
                  our hearts when he popped along with some pretty girl in fine feathers. And then,
                  one morning, there was a shot—a terrible sound that ripped the air, for a moment,
                  leaving a dreadful silence. Our handsome doctor had killed himself. He had no
                  debts, no unhappy love entanglements, no threatened ailment. He just thought the
                  show too trivial. On his tidy desk lay a scrap of note:</p>
               <p>‘The game isn’t worth the candle.’</p>
               <p>Laura wept amid the ice-cream cans in the storeroom, and I suffered
                  something very near panic. I understood too well the queer despair that had lain
                  behind those easy smiles, and I did not want to see so clearly.</p>
               <p>‘My God!’ Laura kept moaning, ‘my God, fancy killing yourself, with
                  so much to live for!’</p>
               <p>Tony slapped our backs with a broad paw, and uncorked a bottle of
                  pop.</p>
               <p>‘Musta been nuts, poor nut!’ quoth he.</p>
               <p>Threading my way into the hills that night, I wondered. I sat down
                  by the old brook, singing to itself so contentedly, and thought: now he had the
                  answer; or the tale was told; and, in either case, life went on as before. Some
                  one else would do his work, some one without that hunger for an inner satisfaction
                  compatible with intelligence and reason. Some allegedly normal young man, who
                  could thrill to a bank account, embrace heaven in the Ten Commandments, and be
                  perfectly content with a world that met his own physical needs.</p>
               <p>The weeks straggled away uneventfully, except that, now, I could
                  patronize the library in my free hours. There were no amusements; anything of that
                  nature within my means would have bored me to tears, so I stuck to my books. I had
                  always loved history, and now I could scamper over the bleaching bones of the past
                  to my heart’s content. It kept me from worrying too much about unco-operative
                  nickels and dimes, and the shadow of the winter coat I should have to buy
                  eventually.</p>
               <p>Racing about in the store, and reading myself silly, kept me blind
                  to Laura’s increasing fatigue, though now and then I used to scold her for eating
                  nothing. Nonsense! She ate heaps of ice-cream. Everyone knew that ice-cream had
                  lots of nourishment.</p>
               <p>Then, one day, she came prancing in with a little brown fur slung
                  from her shoulders. Heaven knows how many dinners it cost. And then she found a
                  suit and a smart pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Finally, a young man, quite a nice-mannered chap, a bookkeeper
                  somewhere—attached himself; and so I gave up worrying about the pinched look and
                  the dark rings under her eyes. She had her beau and I my books. We were working
                  different shifts now, and, by degrees, saw less and less of each other.</p>
               <p>In September I left Kugler’s to try my luck in the tent and awning
                  department of the Marshall-Wells Company. Not a dainty job, but it paid six
                  dollars a week as against four, and I had to have that coat.</p>
               <p>It was a queer experience, stepping into the big, gloomy barn-like
                  department, smelling of leather, machine oil, and bales of canvas. Queer, but not
                  the least depressing. The whirring motors of the machines, the rows of long
                  windows, opening out upon the water, created a far from dreary atmosphere.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clemetson, the boss, was a grave and kindly man, and the two
                  girls at the whizzing machines were wonderfully decent. Margot was a brusque,
                  dapper individual, efficient to her finger-tips. Bertha, her cousin, had the
                  sweetest nature of any girl I have ever met. She was a very plain person, and
                  suffered from chronic bronchitis, but she had the kindest eyes, the swiftest
                  thought for others, and not one shred of feline malice in her whole dear body.</p>
               <p>My first day was spent getting the feel of the big power machine;
                  feeding it miles and miles of double strips of canvas. Then came the light-flies,
                  and, when my seams were sufficiently straight and trustworthy, eight-ounce wedge
                  and wall tents.</p>
               <p>Bertha, ever helpful, rescued me from a couple of crazy blunders,
                  whereafter I was well away as an honourable tent-maker.</p>
               <p>There was an old scallawag of a pock-marked sailor in the shop: Old
                  Nelson, and what a card he was! Nothing but the patience of Mr. Clemetson kept him
                  there, despite his efficiency with the mallet, ropes, and riveter. Nelson was true
                  to the ancient type of salt-water sailor, and could not, for long, eschew the
                  tempting bottle. The dear thing drank like a fish.</p>
               <p>Every so often the old boy disappeared for a couple of days, only
                  to creep in with the distressed air of a beaten pup, his ugly, scarred hands all
                  a-quiver, and his whole, ungainly hulk jittery with nerves. But, oh, how meek! How
                  painfully industrious! And how ignored by the boss—who, when the poor old thing
                  was not looking, winked at us wickedly.</p>
               <p>At his best, old Nelson was, to me, at least, an entertaining
                  study. Squatting on a stool, a mass of tent before him, he whacked away with the
                  mallet, punctuating every tenth ring with a spurt of tobacco juice, expertly aimed
                  at the tin pail some paces to the right. And, when the mood was on him, he
                  chattered of the sea, and especially of the dog-gone-danged heathen island where
                  his ship lay quarantined with the pest.</p>
               <p>For every ailment of the flesh Nelson had the same remedy: whisky
                  and turpentine. Whisky for your guts, and turpentine to kill the dog-gone-danged
                  germs. Sometimes, in the stress of honest emotion, it was quite a cross, holding
                  to these ladyfied expletives; but the boss was a terrible stickler for the nice
                  proprieties—if it killed him, the lion must bed with the lamb.</p>
               <p>Old Nelson was very decent to me, cheerfully coming to my rescue if
                  a huge tent became inextricably tangled behind my machine. Sewing a twelve by
                  fourteen wedge tent of twelve-ounce duck is not quite the same as stitching up a
                  fancy apron, or a cambric dress. Until I became accustomed to the weight, and had
                  the skill to guide the cumbersome bulk expertly over the machine apron with my
                  left elbow, it was back-breaking business.</p>
               <p>To begin with, the mere sitting still, hour upon hour, after months
                  of racing about from dawn to dark, was extremely trying. The constant drag of
                  unaccustomed weight upon my arms and shoulders made me feel like a rheumatic old
                  woman, before the day was done. And, cursed with a ridiculously sensitive hide, my
                  finger-tips were a raw and painful mess.</p>
               <p>But these whimsies passed: my fingers sprouted a protective
                  callous, and my arms stopped complaining. I reached a point where even oiled
                  canvas, stiff as a board, held no terror, and the bigger the tent, the better I
                  liked it.</p>
               <p>One day, jumping up to straighten the folds of a huge house-tent, I
                  got my finger under the needle. Fortunately, I had not depressed the foot pedal on
                  sitting down again, but only spun the wheel. The needle bit through the nail, and,
                  of course, obeying a purely reflex impulse, I foolishly yanked the finger
                  away.</p>
               <p>Good old Nelson rushed to the colours with his trusty turpentine
                  tin, a most abominably filthy tin!</p>
               <p>‘Here now! Here now! In you go!’ said he, thrusting the silly digit
                  into the can, and holding it there for fully five minutes. ‘Ha! That’s good! Let
                  her bleed!’ said he, shifting his quid, and peering lovingly into the murky oil.
                  ‘Many’s the cut that little cup o’ hell’s fire’s fixed! By Gar!’</p>
               <p>Margot clipped the nail as well as she could. Bertha made a bandage
                  from a handkerchief, and the boss poured out a cup of coffee. They were all as
                  good as gold, and the many months spent with them is a pleasant memory. There were
                  problems enough to solve, however. In the fall papa’s job played out, and he went
                  to Winnipeg. Before leaving, he decided we must find a cow. If we had a cow, we
                  should be in clover.</p>
               <p>The only way to realize this marvel was to borrow forty-five
                  dollars from a loan shark at almost 50 per cent interest. It would be my pleasant
                  duty to discharge this obligation in weekly dribbles from my pay envelope. I can’t
                  imagine a less thrilling Saturday excursion than those trips into the musty office
                  of that fussy benefactor, who always seemed to be worrying about, looking for some
                  invisible mouse.</p>
               <p>Peering at me from under a counter, from the grill of a small cage,
                  the dark hole of a steel vault; dark and dusty, with a smile that cracked his face
                  uncomfortably; he seemed to my exaggerated fancy a horrible little man. I hated
                  his pleasantries; his smiling, ‘So here you are, young lady—on time, as usual. And
                  how are we to-day?’</p>
               <p>Sometimes, when the weather had grown cold, and I shivered in my
                  spring coat and thin, unprotected boots, I used to wonder what the old owl would
                  say if I were to suddenly shout the truth. If I said: ‘I’m cold, drat your hide!
                  Wet as a netted fish, thanks to your robbing usury!’ But such things are not said
                  to a nice, Christian gentleman who still owns the head and horns of your cow.</p>
               <p>As the weather sharpened we discovered that the little house was
                  uninhabitable. It seemed to be a question of fewer hamburgers and a warm bed, or
                  freezing to death on a smug stomach. After all, we had the cow. Rice with skim
                  milk was filling enough for any enlightened soul.</p>
               <p>In the course of time the blessed creature was paid for, thanks to
                  a windfall from papa; whereupon, instead of investing in a warmer habit, I bought
                  a giddy rocker and a high-boy. That was a proud moment, celebrated with much
                  coffee and grand talk.</p>
               <p>But, in the main, the season was dreary, with irascible weather,
                  and nothing by way of entertainment. I had lost my taste for church socials, even
                  if I could have indulged the extravagance. Lutefisk gave me the
                  shudders, and the lame programmes acceptable to Pastor Bjerke left me wondering if
                  the dead were all below ground.</p>
               <p>Sometimes I wondered what I was doing on the top deck myself. More
                  especially in the morning, when, at six-thirty, I went streaking for the car that
                  meant an hour’s misery before I escaped into the friendly gloom of the wholesale
                  house. Five miles, night and morning, on the only conveyance that, for some
                  strange reason, turns me to jelly! For weeks I really suffered acute car-sickness.
                  After that, it steadied down to a sort of groggy feeling that introduced the day
                  with a kind of dizzy leer.</p>
               <p>But everything has its compensations. I used to turn my back on the
                  flesh and the devil, so to speak, and rivet my attention to the street; setting
                  myself the entertaining task of discovering odd characters; fixing this and that
                  curious scene in my mind; forming a habit that has served me rather well. But, at
                  the time, it was nothing but an antidote for nausea!</p>
               <p>It was during this year that I also reverted to the infant habit of
                  holding imaginary conversations in my head, selecting my subjects from the crowded
                  car, putting words into their mouths which I thought fitted their expressions,
                  dress, and gestures. It used to give me a start, sometimes, when these people
                  lived up to the part, breaking into the exact sort of speeches, on greeting some
                  acquaintance, that I had imagined for them.</p>
               <p>It used to amuse me, too, despite the wooziness amidships, to watch
                  the chance flirtations under way; to distinguish between the expert philanderer,
                  with his quick appraisal, and the innocent youth with his obvious crush. Poor
                  dears, they needed a practised eye in those days! It was the age of Gibson girls;
                  the age of pompadours, stocks, stiff collars, whalebone, pads, ruffled corset
                  covers, stuffed brassières, long skirts, and tailored blouses. It must have been a
                  tricky business, distinguishing how much, if any, girl there was under all this
                  armour. And when the sweet thing finally yielded to her lover’s arms, the yielding
                  was about as responsive as steel plate!</p>
               <p>Of course, there were cunning tricks: peek-a-boo blouses for dress
                  wear gave naughty hints of pink flesh; and a really daring miss seldom forgot the
                  Anna Held method of exposing a wicked ankle. There was a way of grasping the
                  skirt, in getting on and off vehicles, and even over the curb, which definitely
                  published the alluring line of hip and thigh—providing it was a hip and thigh, and
                  not just cotton padding.</p>
               <p>In the evening, these tailored Gibson dummies gave place to
                  effigies in princess gowns, dolmans, feather boas, floating veils, and enormous
                  picture hats tacked to mounds of rats and rolls with murderous hatpins. But it
                  remained a stiffly corsetted company, secure in virtue and discreet lisle
                  hose.</p>
               <p>None of this sartorial elegance was possible to me. My select
                  wardrobe consisted of two serge skirts and four cotton blouses, which I had made
                  myself at the extreme cost of twenty-five cents, and with these, I wore the
                  approved starched collar and plain black tie. I made my own hat from buckram and
                  felt braid, and sported a sheer wool veil. Not a giddy outfit, but oh, my, how modest!</p>
               <p>One thing I never would accept, however, were rats and a corset,
                  which made me as lax in style as I was odd in lack of enthusiasm for hikes,
                  picnics, Epworth Leagues, oratorios, and cantatas. I couldn’t breathe inside a
                  casket of whalebone, and I couldn’t think inside conventional chicken-runs. Except
                  for occasional qualms about Bannister, of whose rambling round the country Bob
                  kept me informed for over a year, I was quite content to spend the nights
                  alone.</p>
               <p>I had discovered old Miss Rudd one day, selling books in a
                  department store, and had begun reading Shakespeare. Not because it was smart, or
                  elevating, but because I had begun to hunger for ideas expressed with power, wit,
                  and beauty, to read for the sake of reading, which is nothing rare in an
                  Icelander.</p>
               <p>Once in a while I visited the Careys. I had met them years ago,
                  but, as they lived in East Duluth at the very end of Boulevard Drive, that famous
                  roadway that circles the brow of the hills and commands one of the finest views in
                  the Middle West, I seldom went there in my schooldays.</p>
               <p>They were a jolly family. Mrs. Carey was a German woman with all
                  the German virtues, married to an Irishman of good family, a little run to seed.
                  Mr. Carey was a surveyor, and I had often, in my vacations, gone with the family
                  into the logging areas.</p>
               <p>One memorable winter I was stranded with them, in a camp, due to a
                  terrific blizzard. I had to get back to school, and decided to walk. Maybelle, the
                  daughter, and another friend, volunteered to guide me to the nearest village,
                  which was five miles away. There was no road, just a blazed trail, which we
                  followed over windfalls and waist-deep drifts of snow.</p>
               <p>At Nea an old Norwegian woman took us in, dried our clothes, fed us
                  fresh bread, rosettes, and quarts of coffee, put us to bed for the night, and all
                  next day regaled us with the private lives of the villagers. Mrs. Swainson lived
                  in my mind, undimmed, for years, and eventually, like so many other chance
                  acquaintances, popped into a book.</p>
               <p>The next morning I set out for Duluth with a teamster hauling logs,
                  and quickly discovered that it was better to walk than to imitate an icicle atop
                  the load. It was a twenty-five mile jog, and earned me a nearly frozen foot.</p>
               <p>At the Careys, there was always a lot of laughter at my expense.
                  They were all outdoor people, and tried their best to infest me with the holy
                  fervour, with no better results than a good laugh at my incompetence.</p>
               <p>I loved them very dearly, and until the day of her death Mrs. Carey
                  was Mother Carey to me. But now that I was a young lady, Mother Carey thought I
                  should make something of my figure. Really, a few decent stays in a foundation
                  would give me quite a fashionable turn! Then, too, I ought to mingle with young
                  folk, not moon about with books.</p>
               <p>Now and then I went with the Careys to a party: real German
                  jamborees, with fiddles and harmonicas, old-fashioned dances, beer, and Wienerwurst. But there was always something heavy-handed about
                  German humour, something possessive about the men, which displeased me. I was much
                  happier with the family, under their own roof, where the local youngsters often
                  forgathered to sing around the old piano, while Mother Carey fed us raisin cakes
                  and lemonade. And Grandma Rabb, spryest of old ladies, was always there in her
                  corner, smiling approval, vain of her appearance and carefully curled bangs. And
                  there was always a remarkable cat walking about, inviting an audience for his
                  feline gifts and graces.</p>
               <p>It was a friendly house, but a severely regimented house, where
                  every tick of the clock defined certain duties to a hair’s breadth. I think that
                  was what fascinated me at first. Mother Carey was a perfect Bismarck for
                  discipline and efficiency. Everything, from the combing of her magnificent hair to
                  the peeling of cold potatoes for the next morning’s breakfast, was regulated to
                  the exact minute. Not only were there specific days for specific duties, but every
                  hour of every day was predestined to its little dot of labour. Such a state of
                  affairs would have driven mamma crazy. In our house, a new book, or the weekly
                  paper, pushed everything to the wall. You did things that had to be done, but
                  nothing was so sacred that it could not wait for a jolly yarn or a bit of
                  political bickering in the paper! A trip to the Careys was a like a dash of salt
                  in the soup; it stiffened the moral digestion, but a dash was enough. Coming back
                  to the funny little house where mamma sat with her knitting beside the glowing
                  stove, with its heavy, happy kettle humming and the coffee-pot screaming for
                  attention, was always a revelation most welcome. A rediscovery of other, older,
                  mellower values that made you content to curl up like a cat and be your lazy
                  self.</p>

            <div>
               <head>And So Farewell</head>
               <p>There was a nasty jolt in store for me one morning when I arrived
                  at the shop. Business was slack, and Mr. Clemetson had been notified to cut down
                  the staff. Naturally, since I was the youngest employee, I should be the victim.
                  But Mr. Clemetson understood how desperately I needed the job. It was all we had
                  to live on the most of that year. He had made a tentative arrangement with the
                  chief. In former years huge orders of ‘flies’ had been sent to a small jobber, who
                  turned them out at low cost. If I could make these things as cheaply, turn out a
                  sufficient number to justify my salary, I could stay on. The job would tide me
                  over into the busy season.</p>
               <p>Heavens, what a day that was! In this day of motorcars, the
                  honourable ‘fly’ is long forgotten. It was a net of coarse twine that covered the
                  horse from head to tail. It had to be seamed down the middle, hemmed all round,
                  leather clasps attached at strategic places, eyeholes sewn and taped. To earn my
                  seven dollars I should have to make at least twenty in the day. The machine was
                  second nature by now, but the material was tricky, killing to the hands.</p>
               <p>I went at the stuff in a sort of angry despair, timing each fly,
                  racing the horrid clock. At five I had finished sixteen, but was in such a state
                  of jitters I felt myself getting sick. Not figuratively speaking. A few moments
                  recess, a dash of water in my face, and, more peaceable within, back I run to
                  produce two more flies before six o’clock.</p>
               <p>By the end of the week I had struck a stride of twenty-eight flies
                  a day; my job was safe, and I had the pleasure of knowing that no other female had
                  covered so many horses in a single day. I even had the thrill of finding an extra
                  dollar in my pay envelope. Such are the rewards of virtue!</p>
               <p>Time literally whirled by after that, with nothing untoward to fix
                  my attention. Then, without much warning, Bertha came down with a severe bronchial
                  attack. For a day or two we thought nothing of it; she was never strong, and the
                  weather had produced no end of colds, sinus, and other ills.</p>
               <p>One morning Margot came to work late, visibly distressed. Bertha
                  was very ill, and she wanted to see me. After work I hurried to the house to see
                  my dear friend for the last time. Patient and sweet, though every breath was
                  torture; groping for my hands, she smiled at me:</p>
               <p>‘Don’t grieve for me, dear,’ she said. ‘I’ve been tired for so
                  long—so very long. We will meet again—in some happier place. . . .’</p>
               <p>A plain, soft-spoken girl, doing her colourless duty without
                  complaint or criticism, and slipping away for ever, gently, as the seasons glide
                  into the great years. The old machine stood silent for a few days, and none of us
                  dared look at it openly. It was so strange not to see her there, a little bent and
                  ungainly, her red hair tumbled over a fine, white brow; never to catch that quiet
                  smile, so intimate and kindly. Tents must go on: the machine raced once more under
                  another hand. Minnie Nelson joined our small ranks, and quickened the rhythm of
                  existence with her merriment and mischief.</p>
               <p>In the late spring papa wrote to us from Winnipeg that he had a
                  permanent job with my uncle, and had taken a small house. In a few days the
                  packing was done, the precious cow sold, and mother and the two children had taken
                  their departure. I elected to stay behind, and moved in with the Careys.</p>
               <p>Hope and a hundred dazzling plans flared high in my head. I should
                  get myself some clothes, and then save enough money to tide me through the Normal
                  Course. It seemed such a simple business now that I had only my board to worry
                  about. For a time, everything went on gaily. Mother Carey selected sensible
                  material, and made me two dresses and a very perky blouse. I bought a woollen
                  suit, shoes, and a hat.</p>
               <p>By this time it was midsummer. I had a fourteen-block climb up the
                  steepest of hills every night, after an eight-hour tussle with the heavy tents,
                  and the long race with time and the flies all winter had not done me much good.
                  One fine night, after dragging up the hill without much enthusiasm, I suddenly
                  keeled over. Mother Carey trotted me to the doctor, who promptly told me I was
                  slated for the heavenly realm if I did not behave. I was anaemic, suffering
                  nervous depletion, etc. etc.——in fact, a general mess. In plain words, I needed a
                  complete rest, and what was more, I’d get it one way or another, no matter what I
                  did about it!</p>
               <p>The only thing I could do about it was to go on working until I had
                  enough money to pay my fare to Winnipeg. Which took longer than I expected, thanks
                  to a ruptured blood-vessel, and the patching process. However, I was accustomed to
                  physical tantrums. The only thing that upset me to any extent was the explosion of
                  so many fine hopes. Something else caused me deeper pain, however.</p>
               <p>I had seen little of Laura for a long time. Now I unearthed the
                  fact that she was ill in the hospital, about to undergo a critical operation.
                  Nothing that had happened to me hurt so much as the hour I spent with her in the
                  little white hospital ward. She seemed to be all eyes, as though every ounce of
                  vital energy had centred in their wide, grey depths—eyes, and a poignant smile
                  that wrung the heart.</p>
               <p>Her voice was a thread of sound that had in it an earnest of will,
                  like the notes of a little bird singing out a captive heart. What happened to her
                  did not matter, she said. She had managed to accomplish something, after all.</p>
               <p>Last spring, she had taken out a life insurance in behalf of her
                  little sister. Alma would have a chance. Alma would have a thousand dollars for
                  her education! To manage it, she had—well—taken a leaf from the blonde virgin who
                  managed sirloins on three-fifty a week. But God would understand!</p>
               <p>Strange, how the heart can weep and the eyes record indifferent
                  images. Stepping out of the hospital, with its medicated chill and deceptive
                  serenity, the loveliness of the day shocked me into a kind of nerveless
                  subjection, as though some terrible power were forcing upon me some ritual
                  service. A beautiful day: one of those rare, still days, that quiver with deep,
                  integral grace; earth and air and wide blue water conjoined in peace; even the
                  noises of the street had a muted quality that scarcely ruffled the quiet. The sun,
                  heavy with its freight of gold, hung in a smooth canvas of misty coral, veined
                  with violet. The lake was an inverted sky, with one dark ship in its bosom.</p>
               <p>Strange, to see these things so clearly through a prism of tears;
                  to see them with the occult vision of the mind, as one sees in sleep the essence
                  of beauty framing a dear, loved face.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXXIX</head>
            <div>
               <head>Back to the Canadian Scene</head>
               <p>It was early in September when I stepped off the train at the
                  Canadian Pacific depot in Winnipeg. There was no one to meet me, so I was free to
                  experience what I always experience on coming back to the golden west: a quite
                  irrational thrill, as though something in the air itself is a missing part of me,
                  and that now I am complete. A queer sense of coming home that has nothing to do
                  with houses or people, or any tangible thing acceptable to reason.</p>
               <p>I did not recognize a single thing, except the crook in Main
                  Street, but I recognized the old heart-beat under the fine new habit. With my case
                  in my hand, I walked up the old dog-trail, now so proudly paved and builded, and I
                  was glad that no one had met me: that the old city that was, and the little girl
                  that was, had this moment together. Then I boarded the River Park car, and, in a
                  manner of speaking, put behind me one lifetime, to begin another.</p>
               <p>A very patchy interlude followed: a queer series of conglomerate
                  experiences that had no particular meaning, leaving behind them nothing more
                  significant than provocative memories. To begin with, uncertain health made me
                  more introspective than ever, more inclined to sit in the side-lines, watching the
                  parade go by.</p>
               <p>I had some difficulty in adjusting myself to Icelandic society,
                  which seemed to me alien from anything I remembered. Something distinctive and
                  treasurable had given place to Canadian commonplaces. Having suffered ostracism
                  and condescension because of their foreignness, it seemed as though all the
                  national energy of the people had been expended to acquire a blameless Canadian
                  skin, Canadian habits, and Canadian houses.</p>
               <p>This struck me as a little ironic, considering how contemptuous the
                  general run of Canadian was of his own country. The deprecating manner towards
                  everything Canadian was something else that struck me very forcibly, coming, as I
                  had, from a country that believed in its own destiny, and took pride in American
                  endeavour.</p>
               <p>I should have been utterly lost without the friendship of my
                  cousin, Gudrun Johnson, who took me under her wing, as she took any stray
                  creature, and in addition provided me with odd jobs, sewing in her shop. She
                  introduced me to many amiable families, and finally anchored me to the Young
                  People’s Society of our old Lutheran Church. That particular attachment had not
                  the best effect, however. I met several young intellectuals who, while they fired
                  my own desire to amount to something, made me painfully aware of my own
                  ignorance—an ignorance that I then stubbornly refused to believe could be
                  mitigated except in schools.</p>
               <p>I used to listen to these youthful orators flinging borrowed
                  phrases at the audience, and feel myself shrivel inside with helpless shame. And
                  if these bright beings employed a word that was strange, I seized on it like a
                  dying soul. And the same with the subject matter. Some one mentions Sophocles, and
                  I rush to the library and bed myself down with Antigone, only
                  to find, to my horror, that the yarn affects me like any other melodrama.</p>
               <p>Creon behaves like the typical stage heavy; Antigone, like every
                  other doomed demoiselle, hangs herself just a second before the rescuer arrives;
                  all of it exactly what Mr. Mack would have called ‘good theatre’, but, so far as I
                  could make out, not particularly profound, in the ethical sense, at least. But, of
                  course, I am convinced that something is wrong with my head. I desperately pursue
                  the incestuous descendants of Laius, and come to no better conclusion than that it
                  still smells of melodrama.</p>
               <p>What a crazy lot of reading I did that winter, and all of it out of
                  respect for a plain young man who worshipped Schiller and Goethe as inimitable
                  masters, and George Eliot for her approachability. Some day, when his education
                  was completed, he meant to translate The Mill On the Floss into
                  Icelandic. Some day, he meant to write.</p>
               <p>Well, there it was. Overflowing now with all sorts of wisdom, he
                  still thought it impertinence to attempt any original writing. So, what of my
                  secret—my most impertinent dream of doing that very thing myself? Obviously, it
                  was shameful to harbour such a crazy notion. It was then I made an abortive effort
                  to try again for that tempting Normal Course.</p>
               <p>After an interview with the principal, I suggested to mamma that I
                  should borrow the necessary money. Heavens above! Had I lost my mind? How would I,
                  always sick and ailing, ever discharge such an obligation? And so on and so forth?
                  No doubt a more enterprising mortal would have gone ahead, in spite of any such
                  opposition, but I had lived all my life under the foolish fear mamma nursed of my
                  supposed frailty. No matter how many ailments I threw off, or whatever drudgery I
                  performed, she still insisted on believing that heaven was my rightful home.</p>
               <p>But in the meanwhile I had to work. I put in some agreeable months
                  at Eaton’s, in the Mail Order Department, copying orders. During the Christmas
                  rush I worked as a cashier.</p>
               <p>A siege of pleurisy put an end to that, but introduced me to the
                  country and the fine old settlers of Gimli and Icelandic River. All lame ducks
                  were sent to my Aunt Oline to fatten and rehabilitate; and all such derelicts she
                  welcomed with cheerful hospitality. If I have reason to be proud of anything, it
                  is of my three remarkable aunts, for braver women never faced the world. The
                  essence of their service became the theme and the fibre of my first novel, The Viking Heart.</p>
               <p>I made other visits to these settlements, and in my own fashion,
                  tabulated the gossip to which I idly listened. I also spent a happy summer with my
                  sister Anna, in Saskatchewan, where, for the first time, I saw with adult eyes the
                  grand prairie, in all its original wild beauty. Sister’s little house was a humble
                  log dwelling then, shining with cheer and shouting hospitality. It was a magnet
                  for endless visitors, many of whom were extremely interesting, professionals in
                  the making, working their pre-emptions, or teachers.</p>
               <p>But whether they were interesting or dull, Anna had the priceless
                  gift, peculiar to my father’s people, and completely lacking in me, of knowing how
                  to conduct a fluent conversation out of nothing at all. It used to waken all my
                  former infant awe, to hear her break into spell-binding repartee with any chance
                  traveller. She could have held concourse with a rabbit, and left the little fellow
                  gloating with pride in his social graces.</p>
               <p>I found in my brother-in-law, Svein, a quiet dignity and
                  forbearance that deeply impressed me—the spiritual fortitude which I, so many
                  years later, tried to interpret through the character of Bjorn, in The Viking Heart. It was Svein who drove me from Wadena through twenty
                  miles of Virgin prairie on my first visit to the farm. In company less in keeping
                  with the spirit of the land, perhaps I should not have had so vivid a recollection
                  of ageless beauty to remember.</p>
               <p>Perhaps I should not have seen, in the long, tawny grass of the
                  sweeping plain, that gleaming skull which the rays of a westering sun illumined
                  with unearthly light. Poor, bleaching thing! How swiftly the ghost of the noble
                  past sprang from the dust! All the vanished host of the adventurous days now done!
                  An age reincarnated in the twilight smile of the reticent plain; in this deeply
                  silent land, that kept the peace of centuries; in a soft amber light, and a
                  silence unbroken, save by the creak of a solitary buckboard and the muffled trot
                  of ponies’ hooves.</p>
               <p>It seemed to me then, and seems so still, that anything destined to
                  endure, whether art or other creation, must do so by virtue of elemental strength.
                  Let it be crude, let it be faulty, yet if it have, for its foundation, the decent,
                  fearless strength of natural things, the bare bones of the skeleton will endure to
                  give direction to the genius of New Times.</p>
               <p>Something else that old skull brought home to me, and the spirit of
                  the unpeopled plain confirmed it: as the leaves of grass, so are the generations;
                  as a dream within a dream, so is our comprehension.</p>
               <p>The prairie has become a living book to me, every mood a page, each
                  intimately associated with some deeply moving human experience, my own, or some
                  other. There is a sunset never seen beyond the confines of Saskatchewan and
                  Alberta, a conflagration of golden flames, that sets the whole heaven afire—a sort
                  of jubilee of light, that cannot be confined to one small horizon, and flings its
                  lambent banners across the entire sky. The whole heavens on fire, and the earth,
                  sweet as a young bride in early summer greenery, exalted, yet humble, and so
                  softly still: that is a page that brings me back a proud young face, a-hungered
                  with long, long thoughts. Whenever I see this rarest sight, a dear day comes back
                  to me, and a voice, silenced for ever at Passchendaele, speaks in my ear.</p>
               <p>For that, I love the prairie. In that, I place my faith. Dreams
                  never die. There is another mood of the great plains that invades the heart with
                  tender melancholy. Grey rain, falling obliquely, refracting pale sunlight in
                  shards of delicate hue, and all the tangled meadow touched with misty colours,
                  aquamarine, mauve, blue. That, too, belongs to the voice: to the memory of two
                  foolish young people walking bareheaded through the rain, over the tender spring
                  grass, lamenting the golden age when deeds of daring were to do. Life was so
                  barren now. So safe! Sold to prosperity and commercialism. A man should be the
                  master of his own fate, the captain of his own soul. Grey rain, and a quiet field,
                  and somewhere, in the misty dawn, the clear voice lingers.</p>

               <head>My Prairie Argosy</head>
               <p>There are gay, amusing moments I like to remember, from that first
                  visit to Saskatchewan. A brilliant but woefully absent-minded minister used to
                  visit the house—so absent-minded it was said he had forgotten his own wedding day,
                  which so upset the bride she put it off for ever. He used to stride up and down
                  the little room reciting De Profundis by the chapter, and, by
                  way of real substance, passages of Greek. Needless to say, his sermons were above
                  the heads bowed to hear him in the district church. But what a grand man he was
                  for words! said the good folk. Blest if you could make out a thing he said, so
                  fine was his learning.</p>
               <p>When he did emerge from his abstractions he was very gay, and, to
                  me, a fountain of inspiration that fired my mind with even greater curiosity. For
                  the first time in my life I had the privilege of sharing ideas with a man whose
                  thought was profound, groping, painfully serious, not merely erudite.</p>
               <p>He had the humility peculiar to great minds, which made him a
                  comfortable mentor; made it easy to ask even foolish questions. But the fearful
                  thing I learned from him was an irrefutable confirmation of something I had
                  suspected, but dared not believe, by my own inference: that most people did not
                  think, and perhaps could not think, but seized upon popularized concepts as lazy
                  women seize upon a delicatessen shop to save themselves the planning of a
                  meal.</p>
               <p>Naturally, such a mind as his, plagued with scientific groping,
                  could not stay in the Church, where no suspicion of the Christian premiss is
                  possible. He was forced to resign, and later held a chair at Cambridge
                  University.</p>
               <p>Thanks to this encounter, as soon as I was back in Winnipeg I fixed
                  upon a different type of reading. History went by the board, while I wallowed in
                     The Soul of Man Under Socialism; Tolstoi’s The
                     Kingdom of God is Within You, and, more important in its lasting effect,
                  the ancient Dialogues of Plato.</p>
               <p>In all my vexed reading nothing had so deeply moved me as the
                  closing paragraphs of Socrates’ defence:</p>
               <p>‘But, my friends, I think that it is a much harder thing to escape
                  from wickedness than from death. And now I, who am old and slow, have been
                  overtaken by the slower pursuer: and my accusers, who are clever and swift, have
                  been overtaken by the swifter pursuer, which is wickedness. And now I shall go
                  hence, sentenced by truth to receive the penalty of wickedness and evil. And I
                  abide by this award as well as they.</p>
               <p>‘You have done this thing, thinking that you will be relieved from
                  having to give an account of your lives. But I say that it will be very different
                  from that. For if you think that you will restrain men from reproaching you for
                  your evil lives, by putting them to death, you are very much mistaken.</p>
               <p>‘And now the time has come, and we must go hence; I to die, and you
                  to live. Whether life or death is better, is known to God, and to God only.’</p>
               <p>Reading these things over and over in the chill of my ugly little
                  bedroom, I used to whip myself into angry despair at the stupidities of existence;
                  at the blind, who lead the blind, and perforce, would not see. It was not until
                  years later that I found anything written that affected me so deeply. Not until
                  Johan Bojer sounded the same luminous courage through the character of Peer, whose
                  life is symbolic of man’s evolving consciousness.</p>
               <p>‘And it came to me that in himself man must create the divine in
                  heaven and in earth. And I began to feel an unspeakable compassion for all men
                  upon earth—yet, in the last resource, I was proud to be one of them. I understood
                  how blind fate can strip us, and yet something will remain in us at the last that
                  nothing in heaven or earth can vanquish.</p>
               <p>‘Our bodies are doomed to die, and our spirit to be extinguished,
                  yet still we bear within us the spark, the germ of eternity, of harmony, and light
                  for the world and for God. And I knew now what I had hungered after in my best
                  years, neither knowledge, nor honour, nor riches, nor to be a priest, or a great
                  creator in steel; but to build temples; not chapels for prayers, or churches for
                  penitent sinners, but a temple for the Human Spirit, where we could lift up our
                  souls in an anthem as a gift to heaven.’</p>
               <p>But, although the sudden passion for the ancients undoubtedly made
                  me a trying companion for the girls in the neighbourhood, I had my humorous
                  adventures. Shortly after my return from Sister Anna’s I saw an advertisement in
                  the Winnipeg Free Press. The tailoring and alteration
                  department of a certain fashionable establishment wanted experienced power
                  operators.</p>
               <p>Well, thought I, ‘flies’ were not quite the same as my lady’s
                  trousseau, but they required proficiency with the machine. I applied for the job,
                  and, on the strength of experience, got it.</p>
               <p>I was put on stitching suits, a critical operation in a tailored
                  garment, but a straight seam is a straight seam, whether in a tent or a riding
                  habit. However, I had one comical argument with the tailor.</p>
               <p>Why on earth did I reverse the time-honoured process of seaming
                  from the right? For a moment I wondered what he meant, then I saw that every one
                  else sent the material under the machine head, an utter impossibility in the
                  making of tents.</p>
               <p>‘Why not?’ said I, bold as brass. ‘The result is the same, and the
                  material doesn’t wrinkle so badly.’</p>
               <p>‘Oh, is that it?’ He looked at me quizzically. ‘Perhaps you’re
                  right!’</p>
               <p>That was the beginning of an amusing tangle. Mr. Frank (which is,
                  of course, not his name) developed the habit of perching on the end of the machine
                  at odd moments, ostensibly to watch the progress of some garment, though, to be
                  sure, no one would have guessed it from the course of his remarks. He was a
                  sophisticated handsome man, just come from New York to stylize the department. He
                  looked like a swashbuckler masquerading as a fashion plate. He had a curt way of
                  speaking, suited to the swashbuckler, and a mechanical smile that served the
                  trade.</p>
               <p>That he chose my table for a resting-place can be readily excused.
                  The five or six other operators were either middle-aged or hopelessly drab—like
                  the freckled finisher, whose tow-coloured hair was a hard fist on her neck, and
                  whose blouse and skirt were never on speaking terms.</p>
               <p>Then, too, it chanced that it was handier to use me as a dummy for
                  a thirty-six dress or jacket than the plaster model, and, I dare say, after a man
                  has stuck pins down your back, across your breast and thighs, he just naturally
                  develops a proprietary feeling. At any rate, the poor dear began to worry about
                  me. It was a pity for a nice little thing like me to work for her living, said he.
                  A terrible shame, really. There were much more agreeable ways of—well, being
                  independent.</p>
               <p>Not being an utter dunce, and wanting very much to keep the best
                  job I had ever had, I affected a pleasant stupidity. The gentleman retaliated by
                  putting the screws on me. Not in person—oh dear no! That would have been too
                  crude. But the head fitter, a pompous female, who loved fault-finding, began
                  pouncing upon everything I did; always discreetly hinting that Mr. Frank was
                  disappointed in me. Sadly disappointed. Really, I should have to do better!</p>
               <p>So one fine night I waited until the girls were gone, and then said
                  my piece. I was quitting to save Mr. Frank the pain of dismissing me.</p>
               <p>Which fetched a nice little storm, to be sure, an argument that
                  seemed to get nowhere. I could not walk out: he refused to sanction it; without
                  his sanction, I would not get my wages. I was a dear little fool, and should go
                  home and use my head. Yes, that was the thing to do, go home, like a nice little
                  girl, and get over my temper. And come back with my wits about me—what was there
                  so glorious about sewing suits for a living?</p>
               <p>To be quite truthful, I wondered about that in not the best of
                  spirits as I tramped home through the snow. What was there glorious in any of the
                  tiresome drudgery that kept one barely living? What indeed was there glorious in
                  living such a life at all? Millions of harassed creatures like myself were
                  scurrying to and from stupid tasks that went on and on, irrespective of who
                  performed them; millions of meaningless lives, trapped in a meaningless round.</p>
               <p>And then I came to Central Park, where the poplars rimmed with hoar
                  frost stood like the shining ghost of fairyland, and the job I had tossed away,
                  and the flattering independence I could not accept, were alike forgotten. This
                  thing, at least, was mine: a quick responsiveness to transient grace; a singing of
                  the heart that made the earth my own.</p>
               <p>Cousin Gudrun was the only one to whom I confessed this silly
                  episode, and on her suggestion I decided to work at home hereafter, and
                  occasionally to go out on a job she recommended. There was something to be said
                  for such an arrangement. I could work when I pleased, and had much more time to
                  read. It brought me in touch with all sorts of queer characters; earned me many a
                  choice morsel of gossip, for women seemed to shed their reticence with their
                  petticoats, to bare their souls at the first touch of a tape-line.</p>
               <p>Standing forth in all their weaknesses, perhaps they feel called
                  upon to confess the sins of the flesh and the sorrows of disillusionment. There
                  was a lady who, quite unprovoked, assured me she never would have taken a lover if
                  her husband had not been such a glum brute; and a quaint old maid who for twenty
                  years wore the same shade of blue because that was the colour Henry had loved on
                  her when she was a girl. Henry was dead all these years.</p>
               <p>There was a fat woman who boasted of having once been no weight at
                  all. ‘My dear, when I was first married, my husband used to span my waist with his
                  hands!’ But children were such a complication: with each baby she took on pounds
                  and pounds! Married women, who started off by bemoaning the cost of serge and
                  herring-bone, and finished up at the taxes, the expense of modern plumbing, and
                  the destructive habits of husbands who smoked in bed. And there were young
                  shopgirls, who sang an old familiar strain, and sometimes threw in a reckless
                  chorus.</p>
               <p>But it was during a week’s plain sewing in an old house on McDermot
                  Street that I ran into fresh and irremediable disaster. If there were any
                  possibility of forgetting that hot, sultry day, the shrilling cry of a newsboy
                  precluded it.</p>
               <p>‘Sinking of the Titanic! Giant Steamer Sinking!’
                  he shouted.</p>
               <p>The very nice old lady for whom I was making batiste lingerie
                  waddled away on her fat little feet to buy the paper. And, in the midst of her
                  tearful hopes that the passengers might be rescued, the telephone rang for me.</p>
               <p>Cousin Louise, a young clever musician, wanted me to fill in on
                  some sort of programme that was part of the Y.M.C.A. celebration to be held that
                  night in old Elm Park. Some one had failed her, and she knew that I perpetrated
                  reading now and then in the church hall. I hated all picnics, but after a stifling
                  day devoted to the moist charms of a much too vital old lady, the thought of fresh
                  air was too tempting to refuse.</p>
               <p>How often and how fervently I have wished that I had been aboard
                  the Titanic, and not on a street car heading for Elm Park! It
                  was there that I met a young man who completely upset all my senses, the only man
                  I have ever loved as every good novelist would have his heroines love, without
                  rhyme or reason, to the exclusion of everything else under the sun. An Irishman,
                  with all the Irish virtues and vices: irascibility, tenderness, imagination, and a
                  love of good literature that was quite sincere. That, of course, finished the
                  matter. But I had met many young men who were literary—very few Icelanders are
                  not—and many who were much more intellectual; many young men, for whom I had an
                  abiding friendship that still persists. This was something different, as I was
                  soon to discover, to my lasting regret.</p>
               <p>I cannot pretend that the charming creature returned this foolish
                  affection, but he gave a fairly convincing performance to that effect. I suspect
                  there were moments when he wanted to believe something of the sort. But he was an
                  awful snob: he was ashamed of my nationality, ashamed of the place I called home;
                  ashamed of my work.</p>
               <p>Yet, with all this, and much more at fault, he kept tormenting
                  himself with my company. He had my picture taken, to send to his parents in
                  Belfast, along with some ridiculous essay I had written on heaven knows what.</p>
               <p>He used to send me endearing little tokens, some bit of verse he
                  knew I would love; a picture, or a book, and then finished up by being frightfully
                  rude. How did we keep clean, he wondered, in a little semi-modern cottage? How on
                  earth could I have so many superior qualities, coming from such an
                  environment?</p>
               <p>He was a minister’s son, of which he was secretly proud, although
                  he had left home because he hated his father for his narrow bigotry. The pious
                  parent had spanked the children regularly every Friday night; never in anger, but
                  to fulfil the holy injunction of the chastening rod. Huddled in their little beds,
                  the children would wait in terror for the slow steps of the father, coming nearer
                  and nearer to administer the justice of God.</p>
               <p>He hated these memories, and all they represented, yet they gave
                  him a distinction which he felt was utterly lacking in my immigrant heritage. It
                  used to amuse me, in spite of the hurt to my feelings, and sometimes I was tempted
                  to confess that ministers were thick as fleas in my suspect ancestry; that, under
                  stress, I could dig up several knightly honours, one supremely great scholar, and
                  more poets than did any family good; that, at the moment, my cousin was Governor
                  of Iceland, and all my kin over there battling with force and intelligence to
                  secure the full autonomy of their country.</p>
               <p>But no child of mamma’s would have dared say such things. He was
                  the product of his own training, and I found no fault with that. It was a queer
                  attachment, that struck its first serious snag when he took me to task for
                  speaking to a friend on the street one summer day—a young woman for whom I had the
                  sincerest respect; the sort of girl one hears eulogized in the pulpit. All her
                  life was devoted to the care of her mother and an ailing sister. She was a not
                  unhandsome girl, but inclined to be dowdy, although her clothes were good for she
                  held a responsible secretarial position.</p>
               <p>What in the world made me select such hopeless companions, my
                  Irishman demanded, and out flew my Icelandic claws. To question my personal
                  habits, whether hygienic or otherwise, was one thing; to deride my friends, quite
                  another!</p>
               <p>That was the beginning of many squabbles, many queer jealousies,
                  and much heartache. I came to the conclusion that we had better take civilized
                  leave of each other. I wanted to remember the happier side of this curious
                  alliance. To which he agreed, and I, at least, should have been spared further
                  disillusionment if he had kept to that.</p>
               <p>But he came back, which, to my quaint old-world reasoning, was
                  unquestionable proof of devotion. He came back long enough to inflict the sort of
                  wound which lies at the back of the mind like a two-edged sword.</p>
               <p>His way of final leave-taking was, to me, an added insult. We were
                  to have gone to some theatre. I remember I had made myself a little
                  cinnamon-coloured frock, edged with hand-painted borders of green and rose. There
                  I sat, watching the clock. In the morning he sent a letter, which I did not read
                  for some time. When mamma brought the wretched thing I quietly escaped, and, for
                  the one and only time in my life, lost consciousness from sheer emotion.</p>
               <p>It was good to find myself in mamma’s kind arms, to lie there,
                  saying nothing, and having nothing said. After a bit, we went into the kitchen and
                  drank some coffee, then I finished a blouse I was making for some one. In the
                  evening I went to the old Province Theatre, had a good cry, and came away obsessed
                  with only one thought: no matter what my own feelings, I wanted to think well of
                  him, to nurse no distorted ill will—for who can command the affections, or dictate
                  the whims of the heart?</p>
               <p>Resolutions have their merits, but what a chilly comfort in a world
                  that has suddenly lost all meaning. Everywhere I went, everything I looked at,
                  reminded me of what I most wished to forget. Worst of all, I dared not read, for
                  all my treasured preferences were bound up with intimate memories.</p>
               <p>In the end, I conceived the notion of writing to my aunt in Duluth.
                  I knew that she had always hoped that some one of her nieces would follow in her
                  footsteps. Perhaps I might cultivate a taste for nursing. At any rate, I should
                  get away from Winnipeg, and possibly come to understand my relative as she
                  deserved.</p>

               <head>The Face of Virtue</head>
               <p>That much I did accomplish. I came to love and honour my aunt, to
                  see her in reasonable light, and to appreciate the work she carried on with such
                  admirable common sense. It would require several books to tell the tales of the
                  women who passed in and out of the little hospital that winter. Suffice it to
                  mention a few characteristic types.</p>
               <p>There was a spoiled young wife who, despite an easy delivery, kept
                  every one hopping with her tantrums. In the morning, when I came to bathe her and
                  dress her hair, she reminded me of Topsy. Her whole head was a mass of intricate
                  curls, knots, snarls that stood up like angry snakes, impossible to describe.</p>
               <p>Oh yes, said she, ever since childhood, emotion, anger, or pain
                  made her do this to her hair, and no one but herself could possibly undo it. Then
                  she demanded a mirror to keep under the pillow.</p>
               <p>‘I must watch the ravages of my suffering,’ she said.</p>
               <p>There was a girl who, on quitting the hospital, stole a sum of
                  money away from another patient, which my aunt promptly paid, although the girl
                  had left an unsettled bill. Two days later the culprit returned. Uncle caught
                  sight of her, and called out in astonishment:</p>
               <p>‘Ja, here comes the thief, Haldora! She’s sitting down on the
                  step!’</p>
               <p>‘Well, why don’t you let her in?’ said my aunt, looking up from the
                  medical tome she was reading. ‘What are you waiting for?’</p>
               <p>‘You mean to say you’d let her in again? A thief?’</p>
               <p>‘Tut! tut! man dear! What can you expect from a girl like that? Let
                  the child in!’</p>
               <p>There was a young stenographer from St. Paul, who looked like a
                  scared kitten, all eyes and quivering nerves. She was so terrified of what lay
                  before her that it was misery to come near her. The morning after her baby was
                  born I was wondering what sort of collapse to expect, when I brought up her
                  breakfast. What I saw was a pair of glowing eyes and a broad grin:</p>
               <p>‘Gee!’ she piped. ‘The kid’s dead—ain’t that great!’</p>
               <p>Endless women, endless babies, all trailing threads of private
                  history, joyous, tragic, commonplace, and sometimes frankly amusing. Like that of
                  the jolly Irish Lady who had put off her marriage for ten years to save on a
                  family, only to start off with twins.</p>
               <p>‘And would you be seein’ the darlin’s,’ says she, beaming with
                  pride. ‘As like as two eggs, so they are, and not a nose between them!’</p>
               <p>But only one out of the long procession remains to haunt me. She
                  came on the wings of the storm, blown to the door like some wreckage cast to the
                  elements. Because of the gale, her feeble scratching for the bell she could not
                  see failed to rouse us.</p>
               <p>I was writing at a little desk, immersed in the vexatious
                  correspondence regarding little Ruby, whose tale has been told. My aunt was in her
                  bedroom, snatching an hour’s sleep, tired out from a difficult case. It was the
                  sound of something heavy striking the door with a muffled impact, heard in a lull
                  of the wind, that brought me out of the letter.</p>
               <p>What a sight the unhappy soul presented! More dead than alive, her
                  face had a greyish pallor terrible to see, and her limbs would scarcely support
                  her.</p>
               <p>My aunt took one look at her, ordered a bed made ready, and half
                  carried the girl up the stairs. To the casual glance, her condition would have
                  passed unnoticed. She was laced within an inch of her life—a terrible lacing that
                  had turned her limbs an enpurpled blue. As a result of this extreme congestion,
                  although her labour was swift and comparatively easy, she suffered haemorrhage
                  after haemorrhage.</p>
               <p>Aunt worked over her with the energy of exasperation. She was angry
                  and pitying in the same breath; angry with a world that elected such insanity, and
                  pitying the life she fought to save. Something exceptional about this girl touched
                  a deeper vein than professional duty.</p>
               <p>In the midst of the battle, while my aunt still hesitated to leave
                  her patient for any length of time, a most indignant lady descended upon the
                  hospital. Was it true that Lena was here? Was it possible that the shameless girl
                  had had a baby?</p>
               <p>Quite true, my aunt told her bluntly, appraising with a hard eye
                  the silly female, standing there in her sleek furs, lashing herself into righteous
                  fury. That such a scandal should have come to her Christian household! Why, she
                  had never failed to impress upon Lena the beauty of church attendance. The ladies
                  of the congregation had arranged a club for working girls! Oh, it was too awful!
                  To think that she had had such a snake in her house!</p>
               <p>Said my aunt, in the tone of voice that always finished any
                  argument: ‘Seems to me you had two snakes in the house. Your very fine brother,
                  madam, will have to deal with me!’</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, Lena lay upstairs, caring nothing whether she lived or
                  died. She had, in her tragic exhaustion, that white, ethereal beauty that grips
                  the heart with fingers of pain. I used to look at her, lying so unearthly still,
                  her long lashes casting quivering shadows on her alabaster cheeks, and the two
                  heavy plaits of her lovely hair falling like ropes of spun gold on either side of
                  her breast; and seeing her so reawakened all the bitter queries I had sought to
                  side-track with idealistic theories.</p>
               <p>What was the good of brave parchment and fine rhetoric, if it were
                  perpetually reserved for parlour diversion; for snobbish pastime, to be laid aside
                  like a Sabbath garment, in the active world? What was the point in shouting the
                  excellence of virtue, of charity, of equality, and the universal brotherhood of
                  man, in a society that defeated all these things by the very nature of its
                  economic structure? What was the point in ranting against sin and degradation and
                  decadence, in a world so lacking in social consciousness that it made no sane
                  provision for such girls as this?</p>
               <p>Fine words cannot feed a starving body. Prayers do not equip
                  illiteracy with logic, or the means of a decent livelihood. A condescending smile
                  and a dish of beans in church do not feed the hunger of human loneliness!</p>
               <p>I thought even more heretical things the day the church women sent
                  the minister to shrive the sinner. For, true to her type, Lena’s mistress, to make
                  everything right with her own conscience, had not hesitated to broadcast the
                  deceitful girl’s shame. God knew, she had set her a good example, with family
                  prayers, and patient counsel about the evils of night life. But now the poor
                  wretch was thought to be dying! Naturally, one forgot and forgave under such
                  circumstances. A dying sinner is so much more interesting than a living slave.</p>
               <p>The minister chosen for this mission of grace was hardly more than
                  a stripling; a well-meaning youth, I have no doubt, but with all the earmarks of
                  an individual whose severest hardship was a hole in the sock, and whose idea of
                  poverty was the limitations imposed by the cheque from home during his seminary
                  imprisonment.</p>
               <p>The poor thing arrived, visibly braced for the effort, Bible in
                  hand, and a definitely scared look in his eye. When he saw the pale beauty in the
                  bed he cleared his throat, muttered something meant for greeting, dropped into the
                  waiting chair, and hastily thumbed the book. That was all I witnessed, until, some
                  while later, on the point of re-entering, the door flew open in my face, and out
                  shot the young man, with the Bible in full pursuit!</p>
               <p>All very funny, and rather typical of what passes for charity and
                  righteousness in this complex world; an amusing burlesque, except for the
                  consequences. For the comforter left Lena in a state of violent hysterics, that
                  brought on an almost fatal haemorrhage, costing her weeks of invalidism and dark
                  despair.</p>
               <p>I like to think that I helped her sometimes in those black moments,
                  and once, in an interval of near madness, saved her from tragedy. It was after she
                  was up and trying to care for her infant, although the task was far beyond her
                  indifferent strength. I happened to be pottering about upstairs, this particular
                  morning, just as she was struggling with the baby’s bath out in the back hall used
                  for that purpose.</p>
               <p>I could hear the infant mewling with the aggravating insistency of
                  the new-born, and suddenly a sharp cry from Lena sent me scurrying to see what was
                  wrong. There she was, white as a sheet, a crazy light in her eye, her hands on the
                  baby’s neck, shutting off the maddening yowls.</p>
               <p>‘Oh, my God!’ cried the poor thing, when I had snatched away the
                  baby, ‘what have I done? My God! Now you’ll tell——’</p>
               <p>‘Shut up,’ said I. ‘Shut up, and say nothing yourself.’</p>

               <head>I Settle in My Own Country</head>
               <p>Histories no end. But I had not my aunt’s passion for delivering
                  babies. A messy business at best, for which I had no taste or talent. I decided on
                  a much more ordinary career. I had met a breezy young man from Montana who thought
                  he could put up with me for better and for worse, despite my confession about the
                  faithless son of Erin. What’s an Irishman, more or less, to a Norseman!</p>
               <p>In June 1913 I married George Salverson in the old Lutheran manse
                  in Winnipeg. A good way to end all my foolish fancies, and assume a time-honoured
                  business of commonplace existence.</p>
               <p>What a time we had, to be sure! George was twenty-seven years old,
                  but, even so, it was something of a battle for him to free himself from home ties.
                  Ever since he was a boy of twelve he had been the main support of his family. He
                  had bought his mother a comfortable house; his sisters were married; his youngest
                  brother was quite able to take care of their mother; yet it shocked them terribly
                  that George should contemplate such a step.</p>
               <p>His father, who, since quitting the sea, had served no worthy
                  purpose, was suffering with cancer. All the money George had in the world he paid
                  out for an operation. He arranged that the house should be sold whenever his
                  brother deemed it advisable, and the proceeds divided between him and his mother.
                  What we proposed to begin the matrimonial venture on was five hundred dollars that
                  he had loaned to an old man who had taught him telegraphy. Needless to say, the
                  loan was never paid.</p>
               <p>We set up house in prophetic fashion, with a few sticks of
                  furniture bought on the instalment plan, on a salary of eighty dollars, less than
                  half of what he had been getting in the United States, where the cost of living
                  was a great deal lower than in Canada. But I had the fixed notion that here I must
                  live. I supposed I wanted to feel rooted somewhere, to feel that, other things
                  failing, I had at least some sort of spiritual home.</p>
               <p>There is nothing remarkable to remember of those first few years. I
                  balanced the budget by renting rooms and keeping the odd boarder, usually some
                  young man from the telegraph offices. The War put an end to the Winnipeg job, just
                  as we had found a suitable little house, and thought we should have a
                  breathing-space from the bills and the demands upon George from his home. In the
                  nick of time he found a position as manager of the Grand Trunk Telegraph offices
                  in Regina.</p>
               <p>That winter I dawdled away in a suite, with nothing to do except
                  cook for ourselves and a young telegrapher who worked with my husband. For
                  amusement I undertook to sew some clothes for a couple of Russian families that
                  the Metropolitan Church discovered in need. I had no friends, except a middle-aged
                  lady, Mrs. Tanner, who is still dear to me as a living example of true Christian
                  conduct.</p>
               <p>There is nothing to say of my baby, except that the prospect bored
                  me, and to give it an enterprising turn, I decided to travel fifteen hundred miles
                  two weeks before he was born, to test the twilight sleep, administered by a doctor
                  who had been studying the novelty in Germany when the War broke out. In spite of
                  all that was said against the method in those years, it was entirely successful,
                  and my baby suffered no ill effects whatsoever.</p>
               <p>We moved to Saskatoon, and I settled down to honourable
                  housekeeping; pickling, cold-packing vegetables and fruit, and conducting myself
                  with ancient propriety, getting duller by the moment, and thoroughly fed up with
                  the good life.</p>
               <p>As luck would have it, we were surrounded by people who, with the
                  exception of my next-door neighbour, were alarmingly devoted to all sorts of
                  extreme religions. They did their best to convert us, and, out of sheer boredom, I
                  did my best to see the light.</p>
               <p>Speaking seriously, however, I had more decent reason than mere
                  curiosity in these various beliefs. My people, of the older generation, at least,
                  have always been concerned with spiritual values; in the conquest of essential
                  truths that bear upon the inner life of man. That so many extreme religions sprang
                  to the fore at this time was undoubtedly due to the same hunger in so many human
                  beings to whom the horrors of the War were ever-present.</p>
               <p>I was a pacifist then, as I still am, not because I cannot perceive
                  that, in an age of semi-barbarism, war as an instrument of policy commends itself
                  to many earnest people; or that I believe war in itself is the greatest of human
                  evils; but because I had come to see that organized warfare, like every other
                  organized human institution, camouflaged ulterior motives, and was employed, not
                  to maintain liberty for the common man, but to advance the trade monopolies of
                  private interests.</p>
               <p>I had come to suspect, albeit vaguely, that industry, under the
                  present system, is an even more merciless warfare than its violent progeny that
                  marches under resplendent banners; that the millions of workers toiling in
                  factories and mines are nothing but conscripts in a service dedicated to wealth
                  and privilege, and not those rights and liberties that sound so bravely on the
                  lips of sentimentalists. Conscripts, whose slow and lingering death in the
                  economic skirmishes brings them not a cenotaph, but the dole, degrading poverty,
                  misery, and crime. Death for one’s country—if one had any share in that country or
                  that country’s wealth—was not what repelled me.</p>
               <p>My practical Scandinavian nature stood aghast that some less costly
                  solution should not be found by so-called enlightened nations, for purely
                  economic, commercial problems, and all my instincts were revolted that the dearest
                  ideals of the human heart should be preyed upon by propagandists, to feed the
                  sinews of war.</p>
               <p>My husband did not altogether share in these beliefs, but, as an
                  American, he was more or less satisfied with a neutral attitude, until the United
                  States joined in the conflict. Many dear friends, and not a few relatives, were at
                  the front. My cousin served as a surgeon, my brother-in-law left with the first
                  contingent; the two young men who had lived with us a year in Regina died on the
                  Western Front; another, equally dear friend, died from maltreatment in a military
                  prison, because of his religious convictions. These things preyed upon my mind.
                  What solution had the devout to offer?</p>
               <p>Nothing practical, I must confess. Yet there was one sect that
                  interested me somewhat, because of its stress upon mercy and divine
                  compassion—until I discovered that these blessings were reserved for a little
                  flock; until I discovered that all this piety was just another garden plot of
                  fancy, prepared as an escape from the difficulties of human relationships and
                  social obligation.</p>
               <p>To me, it is inconceivable, and profane, that any concept of the
                  Divine should impose a belief in any specific preference for select cults and
                  rituals, or that Christianity is the one and only approach to spiritual
                  discernment. An opinion not particularly welcome to those good people bent upon my
                  salvation.</p>
               <p>There was a very pious group, for instance, which referred to the
                  rest of mankind as Children of the Devil. How poisonous we really were I
                  discovered one fine day when I bought six hens from such a believer. I had no
                  place for the chickens at the moment, and asked that they might remain where they
                  were over the week-end. Saturday night, a timid knock called me to the door.
                  There, bashful and barefoot, stood a small saint:</p>
               <p>‘Please, missus,’ said the child, ‘could you take the chickens now?
                  Mamma says we can’t keep things that belong to the Children of the Devil.’</p>
               <p>There was another brave fiction that rested its case for salvation
                  on Faith in the Blood; works were vanity, and no justification of man’s
                  essentially evil nature. It set me to thinking, at any rate. As I had formerly
                  mapped out a programme of reading, I now decided to dip into theology. I waded
                  through Thomas Aquinas, and other early fathers, who had sought to codify the
                  Christian doctrines into a logical system, based on premises accepted for so many
                  centuries. I took a look at Wycliffe, and Huss, and Luther, and read some of the
                  unpleasant sermons of Cotton Mather. In the end, I bought myself an anthology of
                  non-classical religions, and finished the season with the primitives.</p>
               <p>Surfeited with all these human theories that had cost so much pain
                  and bloodshed, I fled back to the old favourites, which I had resolutely shelved
                  since that unhappy interlude of disquiet romance. I remember well the autumn day
                  when I dug up my copy of Ruskin’s Art and Architecture, for I
                  propped it up against a row of sealers while I stoned peaches for jam.</p>
               <p>To the same accompaniment I re-read Hardy, Eliot, and Victor Hugo,
                  who has always held first place in my affections. The result was an inner
                  discontent that drove me nearly silly. I used to lie awake at night, with endless
                  dialogues running through my head. I used to drive poor George to distraction with
                  my diatribes on human justice, the evils that negative goodness fosters
                  unknowingly, and the cruel subjection of women.</p>
               <p>‘Well, great scott, what’s wrong with you?’ the poor dear would
                  exclaim. ‘Who is subduing you, I’d like to know?’</p>
               <p>‘But it isn’t me!’ I would declaim. ‘It’s all women. They are the
                  slaves, every one of them, slaves of convention, of religion, of the house—slaves
                  in their mentality. Even the modern woman, who thinks herself free, has only
                  exchanged the bondage to one man, to make herself the slave of many. Even in art,
                  women reflect men, ape men, say what the smart man expects the smart woman to
                  say.’</p>
               <p>‘Oh, good Lord, have it your way,’ George would wash his hands of
                  me.</p>
               <p>‘It isn’t my way,’ I would retort, feeling frightfully maligned.
                  ‘That’s what’s the matter with me. I can’t see the sense of going on and on for
                  ever, reflecting images and ideas like a dead mirror. I can’t see the sense of
                  doing everything in exactly the way it always has been done, thinking as you’re
                  told to think, believing as you are told to believe—and the highest blessing, to
                  cook in somebody’s kitchen!’</p>
               <p>Poor George! That finished every argument. I was a good cook, and
                  if he said so, I accused him of prizing me for that alone, and if he didn’t say
                  so, I felt abused. As a matter of fact, I had too much nervous energy to be
                  satisfied with just running a house and minding a baby.</p>
               <p>When the child was two years old I started a dressmaking shop in a
                  seven-room cottage on the edge of town, where he could be safe in the open, and I
                  free to work off some of this spleen. I had done a lot of sewing for various
                  neighbours, and, by way of recompense, these friends brought me trade.</p>
               <p>In a few weeks I was so busy that I hired an Englishwoman to assist
                  me. I managed the house, did all the cooking, kept a boarder, fed my son by the
                  clock, and very shortly was earning enough money to pay my assistant more than I
                  had ever been paid for similar services; and had something more than pocket money
                  for myself.</p>
               <p>However, I began to suffer continuous, excruciating headaches, for
                  I had not only to work through the day, but to do most of the fitting and cutting
                  by night. Strange as it may seem, I had never suspected something might be wrong
                  with my eyesight until now, when working with endless black materials, I found it
                  increasingly difficult to stitch a fine seam and to thread the needle.</p>
               <p>The specialist to whom I finally went was not very complimentary.
                  Any one but a fool would have consulted a doctor long ago, etc., etc. The
                  adjustment reduced me to bed for a couple of days, but I shall never forget my
                  astonishment thereafter, when a whole week went by without any return of the
                  familiar torment. The migraines remained like a faithful lover, but what was an
                  occasional bout, compared with the daily misery formerly acceptable as an
                  inescapable attribute of existence!</p>
               <p>The little shop flourished, and I had the pleasure of buying some
                  furniture, a lovely, brown Wilton rug, and clothes for us all. I even had the
                  strange experience of buying a Liberty bond, and saving fifty dollars for a rainy
                  day. And then George, who had never been free of an office in his life, caught the
                  sort of fever every living creature suffers at least once in a lifetime. He wanted
                  to go on the land, to revel in the marvels of the wide open spaces.</p>
               <p>What really ailed him was overwork and nervous exhaustion. The
                  office was short-handed, and subject to the tantrums of the sort of official who
                  suffers from a superiority complex—a common ailment in men risen to petty power
                  through political influence, irrespective of any exceptional ability.</p>
               <p>George had been working hard and conscientiously, all his spare
                  time that winter devoted to a course in business management and kindred subjects;
                  but, as a long life of service was to demonstrate beyond cavil, such efforts,
                  unless dovetailed with obnoxious subservience and political hobnobbing, are of
                  little benefit.</p>

               <head>Homestead and Boarding-house</head>
               <p>And now George had the grand vision of the independent life of a
                  landowner! Shades of dear papa’s dream! There was nothing to be done about it,
                  except to let the disease run a swift, unhindered course. I hated to give up the
                  little shop, just as it was well under way, but I had no desire to support
                  throughout life, as mamma had done, a suspicion of blame for blocking a cherished
                  dream.</p>
               <p>George quit his job and returned to the Bonus Wires in the C.P.R.
                  telegraph office in Winnipeg. By his working double time, and our living in two
                  small rooms, we managed to save enough money to make the fine gesture. He had
                  filed a claim twenty-five miles north of Prince Albert, and during this winter the
                  logs were cut for a house.</p>
               <p>In the spring George set off in fine fettle to purchase a team of
                  horses, a wagon, lumber for flooring, a pump, and such other requirements found
                  necessary for the initial venture. I stopped off at Saskatoon to make arrangements
                  about our furniture, some of which had been in storage, some rented to a
                  supposedly reputable couple, who had disappeared with most of it.</p>
               <p>I spent a couple of weeks with my former neighbour, Mrs. Gibson, an
                  Englishwoman of great common sense and diversified talents. Before her marriage
                  she had been the matron of a London hospital, and this gave us a common interest,
                  for, to both of us, the human element was a source of endless speculation.</p>
               <p>While I waited for George to send for me, I had the pleasure of
                  helping my good friend prepare for a long-desired visit to England, doing my
                  utmost to invade her innate modesty with frivolous ideas of personal adornment. It
                  used to amuse us no end that Flo should be setting out to dazzle society, and I
                  heading for the sticks to hibernate with a cow and eight chickens.</p>
               <p>The important day dawned at last. Encumbered with small George, two
                  grips, and a box of canned supplies, I left for Prince Albert, to be met there
                  with the most comical sight that ever greeted my eyes. Friend husband was standing
                  beside a spick new wagon, prefaced with the oddest team-mates that ever hugged a
                  whiffle-tree. A mournful chestnut Clydesdale, and a stiff-legged western pony, who
                  dangled in the traces like an ill-advised participle in a pompous speech. Catching
                  my eye, George hastened to explain that the mare, a precious purchase two weeks
                  past, had suddenly developed a lame foot, but the pony would serve our purpose for
                  the moment. The three of us, atop the bright green wagon, made a pretty spectacle
                  as we rattled out of town, the chestnut clomping sedately, and the pony
                  dog-trotting jerkily, with insult in his eye.</p>
               <p>The first part of the curious excursion was not too bad, although
                  sitting in a springless wagon with a heavy youngster in your lap is not
                  particularly restful; but a few miles out from town the air began to thicken with
                  smoke fumes. Forest fires were raging in the north, and each slow mile brought us
                  increasing discomfort. The rancid air stung the eyes and choked the breath.</p>
               <p>The baby began to whimper and wail with thirst, his little eyes
                  reddened from smoke. It was not much farther now, friend husband encouraged us, a
                  few more miles and we should be there, or almost there. It was true that we should
                  have to camp a few days in a deserted hut some distance from our land, but how
                  fortunate the hut was there, since our own cabin was still unroofed.</p>
               <p>What the dear man failed to mention was, that the last mile
                  traversed a section that still smouldered and represented nothing so much as the
                  remains of a gigantic Indian bivouac. The horses refused to budge through a field
                  hot underfoot; and I envied them the comparative luxury of the road, where they
                  were tethered, after I scrambled with George in the darkness over hummocks that
                  scorched the soles of my shoes.</p>
               <p>The cabin was not a thrilling habitation. It had been swept, it is
                  true, and George had set up a bed. There was a table under a hole in the wall that
                  was meant for a window, and there was a rusty iron box stove in the middle of the
                  floor. A lantern gave us glimmering light by which sickly beam I managed to make
                  tea, fry bacon on a tin plate, and heat canned milk for the baby.</p>
               <p>A wind sprang up, and freshened the air, which was gratifying, and
                  I thought to myself that at least we should get a fair night’s sleep. But I had
                  bargained without the mischief of the elements conspiring against a roof of
                  shrunken poles draped with cracking clay. I had hardly settled the forty million
                  kinks that were my body into a semblance of ease, when I realized that every gust
                  of wind sent down a shower of fine dust and sundry creepy creatures that wriggled
                  over my face.</p>
               <p>That put an end to sleep, so far as I was concerned. I preferred to
                  watch a huge silver moon racing dark dragon clouds through the night, to wrestling
                  with sleep under a blanket of worms.</p>
               <p>The next day George set up a tent, borrowed from a man who, with
                  his sons, had filed on the claim next to ours. For which charity, and their help
                  in finishing our own log cabin, I cooked endless meals for inexhaustible
                  appetites, over open fires and the rickety heater, through the hottest weeks of
                  the short, hot summer.</p>
               <p>There was a cow which I had to learn to milk, and the chickens to
                  keep from the hawks, clothes to wash, without any facilities, and the baby to
                  mind. Finally, when the roof was up, the floor down, and a door in place, there
                  was the familiar job of unpacking the household effects we had shipped, and
                  creating a semblance of order and comfort within this shelter of Saskatchewan
                  logs.</p>
               <p>George had a grand time ploughing up a bit of land, cutting trees
                  for firewood, finishing the well, clearing a road to the trail that meandered
                  through the bush toward the one and only highway.</p>
               <p>Then, suddenly, he awakened to the fact that the last of our money
                  had magically disappeared, and the prospect of living off the bounty of the
                  wilderness lost its fine allure.</p>
               <p>Forthwith, he decided to go back to Winnipeg for a grubstake, and,
                  in the meanwhile, I could keep the castle against the enemy.</p>
               <p>The idea of being left alone in the depths of scrub timber, with my
                  nearest English-speaking neighbour five miles away, was not a cheerful prospect. I
                  had visions of myself in the black night, listening to the serenading of coyotes,
                  and waiting for the brown bears that were plentiful in the bush to crash through
                  the flimsy plank door on a friendly call, and the vision did not amuse me.</p>
               <p>Fortunately, there was a Swedish family some miles away, whose
                  eldest daughter, Ella, consented to spend the night with me. She could not be
                  spared from home until late in the evening, but the thought of riding one of our
                  ponies through the woods night and morning struck her as a glorious adventure, so
                  that she was more than willing to hire out as my keeper. A grand girl she was, at
                  that; cheerful and strong, and full of rough counsel that was both amusing and
                  helpful. When work was less exacting at home she often spent the morning with me,
                  which time we put to excellent use.</p>
               <p>The cow took to wandering, and one rosy dawn we discovered that
                  Bessie, the pony Ella rode, a beautiful little bay mare, had disappeared. A few
                  hours’ search, and I found her fast to a willow shrub, in which the stake she was
                  dragging had become tightly entangled. I decided that we must make some sort of
                  corral for safeguarding our three obstreperous animals.</p>
               <p>Tony, the pinto who had suffered the shame of teaming with a plough
                  horse, Bessie, our pet, and the important cow had to be protected. Sure, said
                  Ella, that’s no trick at all. Between the two of us we could saw the trees needed
                  by dinner-time, and maybe dig the post-holes. To-morrow, we could finish the job;
                  and so it was done, with, I must confess, some bruising of thumbs on my part, and
                  much good-natured scorn from Ella.</p>
               <p>During the long afternoons spent alone I finished chinking the
                  house, using chips of poplar, and coating the seams with clay. I built a pen for
                  chickens, roofed over with saplings to keep out the hawks. I made butter with a
                  wooden dasher in a tin pail.</p>
               <p>All was going merrily, until one morning, when a strange man
                  arrived on the scene with a rifle under his arm.</p>
               <p>‘Howdy, missus,’ said he, sober as judgement, ‘I heard you was here
                  by yourself, and I got to thinkin’ you should have a firin’ piece. There’s a heap
                  of vermin in these woods. So I brung you my rifle.’</p>
               <p>That I had never touched a weapon in my life did not alter his good
                  intentions. I must have it, and so he hung it on two nails over the bed, where the
                  sight of it would be a comfort, and the reaching of it handy in emergency.</p>
               <p>Thereafter, I naturally glanced twice at every shadow and suspected
                  every clump of harbouring at least a lean, hungry bear, if not a desperate
                  vagrant.</p>
               <p>But the evening that actually produced a bear, the last thing I
                  thought of was the rifle. I shut the door on the baby and myself, and, from the
                  window, watched Mr. Bruin nosing round the yard, and never even remembered the
                  comforting weapon hanging on the wall.</p>
               <p>But my most frightening exploit had to do with the old mare who
                  limped about the yard. It outraged my sense of justice that the creature should
                  give up the ghost before she was paid for! Something must be done.</p>
               <p>‘Well,’ said Ella, ‘pa says it sometimes helps to scrape the hoof,
                  and put on a manure poultice.’</p>
               <p>To do it, then, thought I, my heart sinking to the level of my
                  boots. Ella fetched the mare to a sawed-off tree stump, tied a rope round her leg,
                  and heaved up the rotting hoof to the impromptu operating slab. While she held the
                  animal captive I prodded and scraped, leaping back in terror each time the poor
                  thing reared in the air when I struck a sensitive spot. No monster of nightmare
                  was ever so huge and menacing as that mild old plug dancing on heavy hind legs!
                  Every snort set me quaking like jelly, but I have yet to start a job I have not
                  finished. The hoof was scraped clean, the foot firmly bandaged, and, I am pleased
                  to say, the operation was entirely successful.</p>
               <p>These crazy months had their value. It gave me an insight into the
                  lives of pioneering people that no amount of visiting and yarning could have done.
                  It gave me two memorable histories of brave women. The first of these was Ella’s
                  mother. She would like me to visit her, the daughter said, for so few came to see
                  her, and she was lonely. Ella could act as our interpreter, and, besides, mamma
                  was beginning to understand a little English; and I had a little Swedish.</p>
               <p>I shall never forget that first visit. The house—such a small,
                  insufferable house for so many occupants—was spotlessly clean. The table, set in
                  the middle of the rough floor, was covered with a fine cloth, and loaded with
                  innumerable Swedish dishes. Two beds flanked either wall; a wooden settle stood
                  under the window; the stove and cupboards filled the far corner. A sideboard, at
                  the foot of one bed, and some benches, completed the furniture—no, there was an
                  amazing picture on the wall; the picture of a beautiful country estate in
                  beautiful southern Sweden.</p>
               <p>Ella saw me staring at it, and in an almost surly tone said: ‘That
                  was mamma’s home.’</p>
               <p>Then Mrs. W. came hurrying in from some chore or other, and I knew
                  that her daughter had spoken the truth, and, to some extent, why her voice
                  betrayed an element of resentment. Between the tall, gentle, sad-eyed woman who
                  greeted me in a soft, restrained voice, and the sturdy peasant who was her
                  daughter, no affinity was remotely possible. They were so dissimilar that I could
                  guess for myself the kind of rude, elemental, handsome creature Mrs. W. had
                  married, heaven knows why.</p>
               <p>And I was right. Mr. W. was the sort of male who stomps through
                  life with hooves of iron; proud of his word; proud of his vitality—he was never
                  sick, never wrong, never defeated. He had been a contractor, and had lost his
                  money. No matter. He would make more, another, better start on the land. His wife
                  and children could work the homestead, while he plied his trade in town. Work was
                  good for the soul, and women were designed for the hearth and the comfort of
                  men.</p>
               <p>By degrees, I learned something of what this finely nurtured woman
                  had endured, and what had come to be the most insupportable. It was not nice, she
                  said, in her faltering, fumbling English, to be so many in one room. It—it hurt
                  so, inside—it was not nice, having the children grow up so—so insensitive.</p>
               <p>She seldom said anything of the endless back-breaking drudgery,
                  except the day following a heavy rain, when I found her carrying all the bedding
                  out of doors to dry. Then half apologetically, she said:</p>
               <p>‘If only Mr. W. would fix the roof, it would help so much. I can’t
                  seem to get the sod right myself.’</p>
               <p>Mr. W. had no time for such nonsense. A little water in the house
                  didn’t hurt any one. There were kids enough to help her haul the stuff about. Time
                  meant money, and money was more important than pampering kids and women folk.</p>
               <p>What she did confess with restrained bitterness was the one thing
                  she found so hard to forgive: the death of her little seven-year-old boy. Not so
                  strong as the others, yet he had to take his turn helping papa in the woods,
                  lopping branches of the newly felled trees. It was cold, perhaps the child was
                  benumbed, and a little stupid with chill and weariness. He had not been quick
                  enough when a spruce crashed down. It had crushed his skull.</p>
               <p>‘Oh, dear God! I cannot forget it,’ she moaned, hiding the tears
                  with her reddened hands, ‘I cannot forget—when I take him to my arms—the brains
                  spill over my apron——’</p>
               <p>My other friend had no such tragic memories, nor was she bound to a
                  man of incompatible temperament or desires. But she had her troubles, none the
                  less which she faced with that amiable cheerfulness characteristic of most English
                  people.</p>
               <p>Before the War this charming couple, whose courtesy and way of life
                  amused some of their neighbours, had been upper servants in one of those places
                  that Noel Coward has satirized as The Stately Homes of England.
                  Mrs. F. had been lady something or other’s personal maid; Mr. F., the butler. He
                  went to war, was wounded and honourably discharged. While convalescing he began to
                  ponder his former ways of life, only to discover that he had lost all taste for
                  such a moribund existence. Anything would be better than a senseless round of
                  bowing and scraping and polished dissembling. He heard of the lands opened up to
                  returned soldiers in Canada. So here they were, and here they were glad to be.</p>
               <p>I used to visit them regularly, once a week, and quite an adventure
                  it was, packing a three-year-old five miles, coming and going, over a blazed
                  trail. But it was worth any effort to reach that bright little home, where a cup
                  of tea and intelligent conversation enriched the hours with peculiar charm. There
                  was no place like it in the entire settlement. It was a lovely bit of England,
                  going on bravely amid the sticks.</p>
               <p>Flowers bloomed at the windows, and in the young garden before the
                  house order and neatness prevailed as much as within. All the usual clutter and
                  claptrap of Canadian homesteads was noticeably missing. Nearly all the furniture
                  was made from boxes and crates that had crossed the sea and half a continent.
                  Little cupboards for pretty dishes; bookshelves, and a dressing-table—which vastly
                  amused bucolic housewives who found no merit in well-groomed hair and a good
                  complexion. I had met that ridicule myself; been loudly laughed at by Ella for
                  fussing with my hands after each bout with the chores. Fancy going to the trouble
                  of making hand lotion from carefully rendered fat, boracic acid, and a dash of
                  toilet water! Oh, she would get over all that nonsense, the practical ladies
                  assured my little friend: curling her hair, wearing white aprons, using sheets,
                  instead of grey blankets, and—of all things!—napkins at the table!</p>
               <p>‘But I do not want to get over these things,’ said little Mrs. F.
                  ‘We came to Canada to preserve our self-respect. These things mean just that to
                  me. See, I have made my little everyday napkins from bleached flour-sacking, to
                  save my few good ones. It may be long before we can buy anything of the sort—but I
                  should hate to save work on the decencies of life.’</p>
               <p>There was a moment, however, when she had been faced by a sore
                  dilemma. It was when her husband’s last trousers showed a treacherous tendency to
                  fall apart. There was no money to buy even a cheap, ready-made pair, but she
                  remembered a length of tweed cloth she had brought from England. So, with as much
                  fear as I had attacked that rotted hoof, the resourceful lady took the precious
                  trousers apart, studied their mysterious details and then fashioned a creditable
                  copy from her tweed. The fit was not perfect, she admitted; a bit baggy perhaps,
                  and lumpy about the pockets. But how proudly they had dressed and gone to church
                  that Sunday! How sure that any and all miracles were possible in Canada!</p>
               <p>My own experiment in homesteading was coming to a swifter
                  conclusion that I had anticipated. One dark and chilly night I heard my husband’s
                  voice singing on the trail, announcing in this fashion his unexpected return.
                  There was no more extra work, and, judging from the slump in business, no
                  likelihood of immediate improvement.</p>
               <p>Taking stock of our scant resources next day, it was obvious that
                  we should not be able to remain where we were. The cabin was not proof against
                  Saskatchewan weather; there was no shelter for the cow and the horses, no crop of
                  any kind, and not enough money to feed ourselves for more than two or three
                  months. So far as I could see, the only possible solution was to use what money we
                  had to bring our furniture from Saskatoon, pay a month’s rent on a house in Prince
                  Albert, and set up a boarding-house.</p>
               <p>In less than a week I had found a big, rambling, nine-room brick
                  and stucco dwelling. It had good lines, and an attractive yard, well treed, and
                  not too unkempt; but the interior was dingy from indifferent housekeeping. While
                  we waited for the household effects we scrubbed and scraped floors and woodwork
                  and wainscotting, varnished and painted and cleaned the wall-paper with oatmeal
                  and brown paper.</p>
               <p>This done, I had sixteen windows to curtain, lengthening,
                  shortening, dipping, and refrilling what material I had. Then I organized the
                  kitchen. Fortunately, I had nearly a hundred sealers of fruit and vegetables left
                  from my cold-packing orgy, when, on the whiff of pickles, plums, peaches, I had
                  eased myself through the religions of the world. This, with a thirty-five-dollar
                  grocery order obtained on credit from our Saskatoon grocer, was my stock in trade.
                  No, not quite all—I had the cow, and I knew how to cook!</p>
               <p>Well, any one who has tried this easy way to fame and fortune knows
                  what the first few weeks entail. The anxiety that no one may appear to patronize
                  the shining rooms, enjoy the menus planned and pinned on the kitchen wall; the
                  even greater anxiety when the first two or three angels draw out of the dark!</p>
               <p>However, in a little over a month the rooms were rented, and I had
                  thirteen people to cook for. Most of them were students, some of whom only came in
                  for their meals. There were two young lawyers, a dentist, and a poor,
                  shell-shocked soldier, whom I had not the heart to turn away, although he often
                  frightened the girls with his bursts of violence. He did not take his meals in the
                  house—people worried him too much—but he liked his quiet room. He liked to have me
                  talk to him, now and then. He had a passion for The Lady of the
                     Lake, which he read and re-read as he nibbled hazel-nuts.</p>
               <p>It was a hectic period. To begin with, when a new roomer appeared I
                  had to dash off to purchase, on the strength of his rent, what was required for
                  his or her comfort. I had not enough beds or bedding, and every sort of goods was
                  outrageously high in 1918. Food was scarce and the price prohibitive, especially
                  of eggs and butter; flour was often of very poor quality. To set an attractive
                  table on a limited budget under these circumstances required some resourcefulness.
                  I used to buy meat by the quarter. I baked twenty-two loaves of bread weekly;
                  eleven brown at one setting, the same number of white, the next. I had no help, a
                  huge house to keep in order, a child to care for, and all those endless meals to
                  prepare on a coal range. George attended to the outside chores, and helped me with
                  the dishes and peeling vegetables when he could. But his principal occupation was
                  to cut firewood in the bush, and haul it to the house. An occupation we find
                  amusing in retrospect, although it was not so funny in sub-zero weather.</p>
               <p>It was not a perfect holiday. I was so tired by the time I went to
                  bed that sleep was usually a lottery with few fine prizes. I would toss about,
                  going over the meals, racking my brains for new ways of serving the same old
                  vegetables, making frantic note of the things Mr. So-and-So could not eat, and
                  Miss So-and-So must not eat, and trying to anticipate something which might please
                  them.</p>
               <p>It was not just a matter of getting three orderly meals prepared.
                  Not all these people took breakfast, or lunch, at the same time; dinner was the
                  only meal to which I might expect them all at the same hour. Breakfast repeated
                  itself until nine, and lunch until two. That left a short afternoon to bake pies,
                  cakes, and bread, shop for supplies, dress myself and the baby, before getting
                  down to the business of cooking the main meal of the day.</p>
               <p>The dinner dishes done, I had to scour milk pans, set the milk, get
                  things in order for the morning, bath the baby, and, after he was put to bed, wash
                  his little clothes. I had always changed his things twice a day, making little
                  checked rompers for the morning, and something more cheerful for the
                  afternoon.</p>
               <p>He was an attractive child, with heavy fair hair and a clear,
                  healthy complexion. He was very little trouble, for he had never been fussed with,
                  was never fed between meals, nor allowed pastries or candy, and had his own little
                  meals on a kindergarten table, and therefore was quite content to amuse himself in
                  his own small corner. Even so, I sometimes used to wish I had four pair of hands
                  and at least two heads.</p>
               <p>There was a morning that stands out in my mind as something of a
                  test of patience. One of the roomers had come in very late, and had failed to
                  close the door properly. When I came down to get breakfast the house was like ice,
                  all my cherished house-plants frozen, and the water pipes emitting gay fountains
                  all over the kitchen floor. The floor was a miniature lake, but, being at a lower
                  level than the dining-room, the water had not penetrated there.</p>
               <p>But breakfast must go on. While George, who is a cheerful soul,
                  though sometimes short on temper, fired the furnace with something more than wood,
                  and flew about with a wrench, dismembering water pipes, I fed my sizable family,
                  sloshing through the icy water in rubbers. When the meal was over, one of the
                  young lawyers stepped into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>‘Lady!’ said he, ‘I take off my hat to you! Most women would have
                  sat and wept, and sent us packing!’</p>
               <p>A welcome pat, bless him—warming to the heart, if not to the pedal
                  extremities.</p>
               <p>For the most part, they were all nice young people. I used to enjoy
                  their chatter at dinner. It gave me an opportunity to compare their reactions and
                  opinions, to mark how differently those youngsters, with ample allowance for all
                  their needs, accepted life, as compared with those whose background was less
                  secure and comfortable. How certain those fortunate ones were that all was well
                  with the world, and all their opinions correct! How utterly unconscious of the
                  fact that nothing but the accident of birth had given them this happy philosophy.
                  How easy it was to foresee them as the future solid citizens, suspicious of new
                  things, and sworn to the comfortable, easy virtues!</p>
               <p>I like them all: the little prigs and the little rebels equally. If
                  I had any preferences, it was for the lonely soldier and the young lawyer, who had
                  always a happy word in awkward moments—although such moments were usually of his
                  own creating, for he was an incurable tease and an outrageous flirt. The girls
                  were in a continual dither. The moment he entered, on went their company faces,
                  and out cropped all their sweetest guile; and none of it made the slightest
                  impression.</p>
               <p>This matriarchal regime was not destined to survive. The flu
                  epidemic struck Prince Albert with such violence that it produced near panic. Ill
                  reports multiplied daily, and all conversation turned, sooner or later, upon some
                  unfortunate and speedy death.</p>
               <p>One morning, the young dentist could not rise from his bed; and no
                  sooner had he been taken to the hospital than all my young folk fled; all but the
                  aforementioned lawyer and the soldier. So here we were, with an empty house, the
                  town in a panic, and no means of subsistence; back where we started, all the work
                  and worry equally futile.</p>
               <p>Then I came down with the flu. That did not particularly upset me.
                  I had had a bout with it when it struck before; had it in Saskatoon, at a time
                  when I happened to be alone in the house, my husband away in the country.</p>
               <p>There is no point in labouring that experience; but, since I had
                  survived nights and days of raging fever, when, drenched with perspiration, I had
                  to drag myself out of bed to tend to the baby, I certainly had no reason to fly
                  into a panic now. George was home, and did what he could for me, keeping the house
                  warm, fetching me hot lemonades, putting wet cloths on my head, and caring for the
                  child.</p>
               <p>To be sure, when three days passed and I was still on my back, his
                  patience cracked a bit. If I were as ill as this, I should have a doctor. I didn’t
                  seem to be making much headway at this rate, etc., etc.; all very sensible, but
                  not particularly soothing. I did not want a doctor, for I was suffering from the
                  complex an empty pocket so readily creates. I was thinking of the rent to be paid,
                  of the grocer, and the butcher, and the vacant rooms; of the fixed overhead, which
                  neither doom nor death altered. I had not the heart to run up bills for
                  myself.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, George was not idle. I question that even the ease of
                  Paradise would reduce him to such luxury! He flew about doing a thousand things,
                  sending wires and letters, scouting some job, going to the bush for firewood,
                  tending the cow and the horses and the house. He had discovered he was not born to
                  the soil, so he contracted with a returned soldier to take the homestead off his
                  hands. And, at the darkest moment, as so often happens, he found an opening in the
                  railway service. An operator was needed at Biggar, Saskatchewan. He had to leave
                  at once.</p>
               <p>So there I was, scarcely able to leave my bed, with a barn of a
                  house in midwinter. The furnace was of the old-fashioned variety, fed four-foot
                  logs of wood. I had to sit down on the cellar steps after each stoking orgy.</p>
               <p>However, in a few days I had sufficient energy to form some sort of
                  plan. I decided to auction all the household effects, except my books, the piano,
                  some kitchen ware, and dishes; and thus square my accounts and be free to make
                  another start.</p>
               <p>When it came to making ready for the sale and packing what I could
                  not keep, one of the girls came back, offering to help me—a girl of mixed blood
                  and limited means; and my soldier insisted upon crating the books and tying boxes.
                  He also insisted upon spending the last night in the house, after the furniture
                  was sold, sleeping on a mattress in his empty room. It has been my experience in a
                  not too easy life that publicans and sinners, and the humble of earth, are more
                  dependable in an unpopular hour than their respected brethren.</p>

               <head>Birth of an Author</head>
               <p>It is true that every evil has its germ of good. Life looked pretty
                  black—which, doubtless, was just the state of my liver; it seemed to me that all
                  my best efforts to conform to the time-honoured duties of women had brought me
                  nothing but endless work and disillusionment. I had no life of my own, no inner
                  satisfaction, no feeling of justifying my existence. When I watched the sale of
                  piece after piece that represented so many dresses sewn, so many coats, so many
                  hours of placating the whims of fussy customers; hours that other housewives spent
                  in social pleasures, I made up my mind that I should appropriate something of the
                  spoils. I made up my mind to use some of this money for a course in English.</p>
               <p>Biggar was not an inspiring village, nor were the houses to let any
                  woman’s dream of bliss. We found a small cottage, minus all modern improvements
                  and on the very edge of a windswept plain, that, after the usual painting and
                  varnishing, was comfortable enough. It was heated by stoves and lighted with
                  lamps, in the good old ancient manner. As soon as I had completed the household
                  arrangements, I enrolled with the Extension Department of an American school, and
                  put my mind upon syntax and composition.</p>
               <p>While the March wind howled and filled the earth and air with snow,
                  I sat there under the kerosene light, trying to recapture my one-time passion for
                  words, tearing through dry lessons on technicalities, some quite familiar, and
                  perceiving by degrees that none of this was what I really wanted.</p>
               <p>I wrote to the school, asking to be permitted to submit
                  compositions for corrections, rather than papers on parts of speech, and so forth.
                  But, of course, that was out of their province.</p>
               <p>So I disregarded their scholastic advice, and wrote for myself,
                  with no better guide than my sense of rhythm and dislike of useless verbiage. I
                  wrote verse for two reasons: first, because the simple forms were no effort; and
                  secondly, because it focused my thoughts to a restricted, short, set medium. But I
                  should never have dreamed of imposing these gymnastics upon any one. Not until I
                  had written quite a batch of rhymes that showed a minimum of promise did I commit
                  the stuff to any one else; and then to Mr. Reeve, former editor of The Writer, for correction and comment.</p>
               <p>One of the pleasant memories of Biggar arose from these lamplight
                  experiments. Mr. Watt, one of the train dispatchers, who at this time was
                  initiating my husband into that phase of railroading, took it into his kind heart
                  to furnish me with better illumination. I shall never forget the terrible, stormy
                  day when, trudging through knee-deep snowdrifts, he arrived at the cottage with an
                  Aladdin lamp under one arm and a bundle of neatly shaved kindling wood under the
                  other! But then, as I was to learn from others, Mr. Watt was the kind of soul who
                  seeks out kind deeds for the doing, as others seek out pleasures for
                  themselves.</p>
               <p>The next year we were back in Regina, George working the third
                  trick as train dispatcher, and I wrestling with words, as poor Jacob wrestled with
                  the angel. I began to mail out some of this pain and agony, and, I am glad to say,
                  most of it came back. In time, however, an occasional verse was printed in country
                  papers.</p>
               <p>I dug out my old Latin grammar, with some notion of perfecting my
                  sense of derivatives. I wept over Victor Hugo, and would have liked to bathe his
                  feet with these tears! I cared nothing whatsoever for my mental offspring. I had
                  not listened to papa satirizing inane verse without acquiring some sense of what
                  constituted poetry. I had not the slightest ambition to become a homespun poet.
                  What I wanted was the language of ideas, and liberty to express ideas in a medium
                  that should transmit something of my national flavour. I tried my hands at a few
                  bits of prose, and found them feeble and foolish. Then I wrote two short stories,
                  one of them destined to win the Canadian Club prize the following year.</p>
               <p>But all of this went on under disheartening circumstances. I had no
                  literary friends—no friends at all, in fact, except Mrs. Tanner; and my health was
                  steadily going down hill. Everything I ate seemed actually to poison me. Dr.
                  Henderson, to whom I had finally to admit this defeat, put me on various diets,
                  which gave temporary relief. The flu had left me this gift, said he, but the
                  serious thing was my heart. It was strained—whatever that means—which explained my
                  shortness of breath, and sundry other unreasonable aberrations. Thankful that the
                  old bogey of tuberculosis had not overtaken me, I returned to my scribbling, my
                  canning, my cooking, and seemingly made no more progress than a cat chasing its
                  tail.</p>
               <p>Then fate took a hand. Dr. and Mrs. Andrews became interested in my
                  verses. They did more: they took me to their home, and their hearts, thereby
                  opening up a new world to my starved spirit. Not long thereafter, the University
                  Women’s Club began making preparation for Bliss Carmen’s first visit to Regina.
                  Mrs. Andrews suggested that I should write a verse of welcome to the poet, which I
                  did in fear and misgiving, never dreaming what was to come of it.</p>
               <p>Nothing could have prevailed upon me to read the thing, or to have
                  my name mentioned. Mrs. Andrews elected to do it, and did it so well that the poor
                  little effort acquired merit through the sympathy of her voice. In the audience
                  was a young Scotsman, whose passion for letters made him eager to follow any
                  glimmer of Canadian talent: the late Austin Bothwell whose faith in my ability
                  decided my future, and to whom I owe a debt of gratitude that words cannot
                  express.</p>
               <p>Without the encouragement of Mr. Bothwell and his dear wife,
                  Jessie, I should never have dared to attempt a serious piece of work, or come to
                  recapture the hope which had always lain at the back of my mind since that
                  long-gone day in the West Duluth Library, when my heart quickened with the
                  determination to write a book. But to dream and to act are not quite the same. I
                  had yet to conquer my self-mistrust, my fear of ridicule upon the ultimate
                  discovery that I was just what papa would call another miscreant of letters, and I
                  was sorely depressed.</p>
               <p>However, enheartened by Mr. Bothwell’s report upon the few things I
                  sent him, I kept scribbling away, jotting down scenes and dialogues that ran
                  through my head as I went about the household chores. It was then that I realized
                  how good a service nausea had done me during those dreaded street-car rides. I
                  could carry on pages of conversation as I flew about, dusting, sweeping, ironing,
                  and baking, and never lose a word of it! I could visualize, without any particular
                  effort, scenes that I had thought long since forgotten. I had only to recall some
                  quaint turn of speech heard in the drug store, on the street corner, or in the
                  theatre, and all of it was there in my mind’s eye. Without this ability I should
                  never have been able to write as much as I did write in the next few years.</p>
               <p>All those years of bondage to stupid duties had taught me to
                  regiment and perfect mechanical labours to an extent that left my mind free to
                  pursue more fascinating speculations. And I could support a terrific grind. For
                  instance, when I was doing research for Lord of the Silver
                     Dragon, I worked at that particular task from midnight until three in the
                  morning. The first part of each day was devoted to housework. After lunch, I wrote
                  usually from two to five. When dinner had been disposed of I became a human being,
                  entertaining a few friends, or going out somewhere with my husband.</p>
               <p>Except on rare occasions, I was back in my own room by ten o’clock.
                  From then until eleven, when I made my husband’s midnight snack before his going
                  to work, I amused myself with some sort of extension work.</p>
               <p>But all this was in the future. I was still in Regina, full of
                  doubt and hesitations, much more certain that I should can the vegetables from the
                  garden than write a book. That I gradually recovered a modicum of courage I have
                  to thank the literary society which met every week in the public library. It was
                  there that I partly learned to creep out of my mental shell. It was there I met my
                  faithful friend, George A. Palmer, whose amiable humour and catholic interests so
                  greatly helped to put me at ease.</p>
               <p>The outstanding event of the winter, however, was a little party
                  given in honour of Mrs. McClung, who had just returned from England, and was
                  lecturing in Regina. Just an intimate, friendly gathering, at the home of Mr. and
                  Mrs. McLeod, but, for me, it was a memorable occasion—my first introduction to a
                  Canadian author. I am forced to admit that I knew very little of Canadian
                  literature, in general, and had only read Mrs. McClung’s Sowing
                     Seeds in Danny. But I had loved her for painting, with sympathy, obscure,
                  inconsequential folk, and more especially for the work she had done on behalf of
                  women.</p>
               <p>Naturally, I looked forward to the occasion with a mixture of
                  pleasure and dread. So many idols are better left in their shrines; so many actors
                  are disappointing out of character. To bolster up my timidity, I made myself a new
                  dress, sitting up half the night to do it, and bought my first pair of really good
                  shoes. Thus, shod with respectability, if not clothed in my right mind, I sallied
                  forth to make my bow to Canadian achievement. Recalling those nervous qualms, I am
                  tempted to laugh. For surely no famous person ever wore laurels more gracefully
                  than Mrs. McClung!</p>
               <p>It was a pleasant evening, and I was purring with contentment that
                  a woman both celebrated and handsome was free of all vanity and pretence. Yet I
                  was a little disappointed that nothing was said of books, as such. I had, without
                  being conscious of it, I suppose, a purely European attitude. I should have liked
                  the guest of honour to hold forth in fine Bjornson style on some aspect of
                  politics, or discourse upon points of literature after the famed Anatole France
                  pattern. Certainly I could not imagine any group of Icelandic intellectuals
                  behaving so mildly! Like the Jews, we have a passion for ideas; and the more
                  provocative they are, the better we like them. It is not escape from ourselves and
                  the problems of existence that we seek in our mental diversions, but a stimulus to
                  curiosity and thought.</p>
               <p>What I chiefly remember of that amicable evening is my impression
                  of Mrs. McClung; her generosity to any writer mentioned and the delightful quality
                  of her slightly husky voice.</p>
               <p>Before the little gathering broke up something was said apropos of
                  beginners in fiction—something I accepted without reservation, and which I
                  fervently wish had never been uttered. According to this opinion, if you knew your
                  subject, and had the perseverance to master a plain, lucid style, eventual success
                  was a foregone conclusion. I also gathered that editors were sitting on the edges
                  of their chairs, waiting for the Canadian product, and all the intellectual world
                  searched the heavens for signs of a forthcoming great Canadian novel.</p>
               <p>I had no delusions of grandeur, but, if this were true it seemed to
                  me that I had less to fear; more reason to hope that my individualized reaction to
                  the Canadian scene might meet with some favour.</p>
               <p>As a matter of fact, what I should have been told was to shed my
                  Icelandic hide and every vestige of national character as quickly as possible!
                  Saying which, I do not mean to imply that I, as an individual, have suffered any
                  discrimination because of my nationality. That would be far from true. It is a
                  long time since any one thought me suspect for no better reason than that. Of
                  course, I have still to explain, with slightly diminishing enthusiasm, that
                  Icelanders are a Norse people, with social institutions a thousand years old; that
                  the country is not an ice cake, but a sizable cauldron of volcanoes and hot
                  springs. And I have still to smile politely when helpful mortals rush to my rescue
                  by saying: ‘Oh, I knew an Icelander, once—such a nice person,
                  too!’</p>
               <p>What I should like to make clear has nothing to do with such
                  harmless commonplaces. It was something quite different, and much harder to
                  define, something instinctive, that affected my point of view and made it strange,
                  and even offensive, to other popular beliefs. I had been conditioned in liberal
                  thought, and came naturally by a genuine curiosity in every shade of opinion. In
                  spite of her individual preference for the forms of the high church, my mother
                  imposed no dogma upon her children, and she considered all attempts to censor
                  reading and other common amusements insulting to the human intelligence.</p>
               <p>I remember her disgust with a pious lady who expressed surprise
                  that I should be reading a novel. A book that, most likely, dealt with disgusting
                  examples of depravity and sin! Imagine the effects it would have upon me!</p>
               <p>‘Don’t be an ass!’ said mamma. ‘If such things are written about,
                  they must exist, and it’s high time we found out about it. There is little merit
                  in sanctimonious blindness!’</p>
               <p>All her life mamma read whatever came to hand, and her last request
                  in this world was for light—plenty of light, and a good story!</p>
               <p>As for my father, any new discovery, any theory, of whatever kind,
                  he seized upon with eagerness and interest. We never enjoyed material blessings,
                  but we certainly had the benefits of complete mental freedom and boundless
                  interest in the lives of our fellow creatures; in human beings, as they were, not
                  as we wished them to be! Such an attitude toward life was the first obstacle in
                  the way of successful authorship.</p>
               <p>Humanity was for me a sort of living hieroglyphics of the life
                  principle: generations upon generations translating into acts and deeds the
                  strange forces that impelled them; a fancy which lent fascination to the dullest
                  life.</p>
               <p>The second, and greater obstacle, was my conception of the purposes
                  of fiction. Old-fashioned Icelanders did not look upon the sagas as something to
                  kill time. They had, indeed, no predilection for such a curious desire. Even as an
                  old woman my mother hated to go to bed—sleep seemed such a waste of life! To our
                  way of thinking, even light fiction failed of its purpose to interest or amuse if
                  it did not in some way extend the mental horizon. If there was nothing in the
                  story to provoke a novel train of thought, nothing that gave you an intriguing
                  glimpse of human foibles, nothing that touched on the springs of beauty in nature
                  or in man, then why trouble to read the thing? A cup of coffee would do just as
                  well, if all you wanted was mental oblivion!</p>
               <p>With such an unfortunate conviction rooted in mind, it never even
                  occurred to me that I should sit down to invent a sort of Punch and Judy show,
                  mechanically timed to a prescribed tune, which changed with epidemic propulsion at
                  cyclic intervals. Glad books, sad books, mad books, bad books—like the plagues of
                  Egypt! For instance, when I finally resolved to write of such people and events as
                  were thoroughly familiar, the pioneers of the west, the fiddler had called another
                  tune. The American continent had discovered sex! It had discovered thoughts!</p>
               <p>Just how the world wagged along before this flaming revelation
                  shook the continent, was a mystery. The only mystery—everything else, from
                  Grandma’s wandering thoughts as she munched a lettuce salad
                  with vital relish, to the gurgling of a baby nursing its toes, was ripped of
                  pretence, and bravely shown in its full, erotic significance. The poor old earth
                  writhed with complexes and repression. Even sleep afforded no escape. The demon
                  pursued you down Elysian fields with matchless subterfuge and cunning.</p>
               <p>Such a horrible state of affairs ought not to be endured, shouted
                  the glandular prophets. Mankind must be free as its fiercest desire, free as the
                  elk and the goose. Dreadful indeed were the psychopathic tragedies depicting the
                  warped women whose horrid husbands snored in their sleep, and served no romantic
                  purpose in their waking hours. Bold were the modern Judiths who beheaded the
                  monster Restraint, and went a-hunting the proper mate. Gallant souls, who, it must
                  be admitted, reminded me just a little of the less enlightened ladies at the court
                  of the Merry Monarch.</p>
               <p>To fly in the face of this brave new convention, with tales of
                  antiquated mortals who stubbornly believed in the larger loyalties of social
                  obligation, in honour and friendship and the human spirit, was not a sensible
                  course. In fact, it was an almost fatal course, since the only other popular
                  medium of fiction—mawkish sentimentality—was just as impossible to me.</p>
               <p>Any single week in my aunt’s hospital would have supplied me with
                  material for six turgid novels. With no arduous invention, I could have acted upon
                  the advice of a successful author who, after reading Lord of the
                     Silver Dragon, said to me: ‘When you can write like that, why waste your
                  time? Write of love—and make it illicit!’</p>
               <p>Honest counsel, but, like my deluded characters, I had my own
                  peculiar loyalties. There were the ancestors—which is to say, there were
                  obligations of common decency to men and women who had laboured long and hard in
                  the service of humanistic ideals.</p>
               <p>At this point I should like to make clear another peculiarity of
                  Icelandic ideology. When a group of old friends gather round the coffee table, and
                  suddenly trot out Grandfather So-and-So, and Great-grandmamma Something-Else, it
                  is not done to create an impression. The Icelander rakes up the ancestral fires in
                  search of some glowing ember of integrity and merit whereby to light his own
                  spirit and quicken his heart with courage against the dark future. The ancestors
                  were a sort of spiritual scourge. When a scholarly old gentleman once told me of
                  an ancestress who, in ancient times of famine, retired to the church to write
                  poetry ‘in the peace of God, until He claimed her’, it was not told as an example
                  of family distinction, but given as the reason for his own dutiful striving to
                  surmount the obstacles of poverty and ignorance. He was not proud of his
                  ancestors. He only hoped he had not disgraced them.</p>
               <p>All of which will doubtless seem a strange invention, but the fact
                  remains, that to the immigrants of Canada this need to justify their race was a
                  powerful and ever-present incentive to courageous effort. It did not surprise me,
                  therefore, that papa’s first comment upon being told that I intended to write a
                  book was not very flattering.</p>
               <p>‘My dear,’ said he, ‘are you sure it will be a good book? There are
                  so many bad books the old bards must shudder to see!’</p>
               <p>But I am anticipating. I was still writing verse, in the queerest
                  moments. I was getting breakfast one morning when a sudden burst of melody drew me
                  to the window. There, on the telephone wires, a meadow lark sang out his little
                  heart, and, having done, soared off into the sky. I used to feed the little
                  singers oatmeal, bits of suet, and crusts. I loved them, as the most beautiful
                  attribute of the beautiful prairie. Now, it seemed to me I should fix this
                  affection in some way. So, while the bacon frizzled in the pan, I sat down on the
                  threshold and wrote: ‘The Creation of the Birds’.</p>
              
               <p>When brooding o’er the earth newly created——</p>
               <p>  Where in her pristine splendour fair she
                  lay,</p>
               <p>  A beryl beauteous, ’mid encircling waters——</p>
               <p>The Lord grew lonely through the dragging day.</p>
               <p rend="noindent"> </p>
               <p>So, from the sun He took a spark of glory,</p>
               <p>  And from the clouds their lovely summer hue,</p>
               <p>  And from the winds the breath of dreaming
                  ages,</p>
               <p>And from the fern the ever-sparkling dew:</p>
               <p rend="noindent"> </p>
               <p>With all these things, in love and exultation,</p>
               <p>  The little birds He formed, with deep
                  delight;</p>
               <p>  And cast them forth from out His holy bosom,</p>
               <p>To make Him glad with song from morn till
                  night.</p>
               <p>Hidden Fire, my first short story, was awarded
                  the Canadian Club prize in the summer, and I had the terrifying experience of
                  receiving it from the hands of Lady Byng, with nothing better to wear than a voile
                  dress and a newly dyed hat, which smelled to high heaven.</p>
               <p>My happiness in the event derived from the pleasure the Bothwells
                  took in this small success. They were so sure it prophesied better things ahead.
                  It was not so difficult to believe it, on the rare occasions that I spent in their
                  invigorating company. Mrs. Bothwell was like a fine flame that melted the chill in
                  my heart. Austin Bothwell was a scholar and a Scotsman. I dared not doubt him. If
                  he said that I could write, I had to write. It became a duty that obsessed me
                  night and day.</p>
               <p>A fortunate obsession, no doubt, for I was not privileged to enjoy
                  this inspiring friendship for long. In the fall we went to Edmonton, where my
                  husband worked as swing-dispatcher, which means that he relieved the regular trick
                  men in Edmonton on their allotted days off, and then repeated the process in
                  Biggar.</p>
               <p>We found a suite on the wrong side of town, where rents were
                  supposed to be cheaper, and when I had settled the place to the best of my
                  ability, I began to think about the task Mr. Bothwell had charged me with: to
                  write a book about my own people. I had never heard any technical points
                  discussed. I had no idea that such material was available. I knew nothing, in
                  fact, except what I wanted to represent.</p>
               <p>That was clear enough, after a fashion. I wanted to write a story
                  which would define the price any foreign group must pay for its place in the
                  national life of the country of its adoption. I wanted this payment to express
                  spiritual values, which, to my way of thinking, are the true measure of national
                  greatness, the only riches that abide, and which make a nation endure.</p>
               <p>How to do it was still a mystery. I wrote to my father, at the time
                  living in Gimli, and, through him, arranged for a meeting with two elderly
                  gentlemen who had kept a record of the early Icelandic settlement. While I waited
                  for my flying vacation, so to speak, I began jotting down episodes with which I
                  was familiar, and almost at once the characters who were to enact these
                  experiences took shape in my mind.</p>
               <p>They did more: they began to haunt me in my sleep. I had one
                  peculiar experience that was repeated two nights running. I had no more than
                  dropped off to sleep than a woman drew out of the shadow. A sad, distraught,
                  creature, who bore, in her extended arms, a beautiful child, whose golden curls
                  and small, waxen figure were dripping water. It was so real, so tragically moving
                  that I woke with a start. I must be getting a little mad, I thought—altogether too
                  obsessed with my subject. I had no memory of any such incident, and had no
                  intention of incorporating it into my book.</p>
               <p>But when, some ten days later, I met the two old gentlemen in
                  Gimli, the first tale they told me was of a poor woman whose child had been
                  drowned, while she was charring for the daily bread; drowned in a little creek
                  that used to traverse Market Square, where the Winnipeg City Hall now stands. So
                  small Lillian found her place in my book. As a matter of fact, I seemed to have
                  little to say as to how any one behaved in that book.</p>
               <p>For instance, I had a dear old gossip in mind to act as a sort of
                  spiritual buffer when I invented Finna, but Finna refused to be invented: she took
                  on flesh and blood, and ran away with the story.</p>
               <p>Back in Edmonton, I hired a second-hand typewriter, bought a
                  kitchen table and some Manilla papers, and shut myself up in a slice of room to
                  draw up the skeleton of the story. As I said before, I had no knowledge of the
                  mechanics of writing. But I did have sense enough to know that it was impossible
                  to create a story out of vague, disconnected scenes. I had to see the end before
                  there could be any beginning. When the last paragraph finally came to me—and it
                  came while I was doing the week’s ironing—I knew that I should somehow find the
                  right opening. When the ironing was finished, I wrote down my last paragraph:</p>
               <p>‘For in such strength alone do nations live, have their beginnings,
                  and everlasting power. Out of the hearts of men, out of their joys and tears,
                  their toil and tribulation, springs that illusive, and holy thing, the Soul of a
                  Nation.</p>
               <p>‘Out of the sore travailings of men, and out of their quiet death,
                  spring hope and faith, and that great love which, transcending the grave,
                  revitalizes life, and makes a nation indestructible.’</p>
               <p>I looked at these words, and there swept over me the same emotion
                  which I had experienced so often as a child, when I saw the sun go down, leaving
                  the world in grey widow’s weeds. How often I had watched such a scene from a
                  small, uncurtained window, opening out upon the little creek, and, with a queer
                  ache at the heart, tried to imagine what argosies of human joys and sorrows,
                  completed and done, were drawing beyond the rim of the world on the brave banners
                  of the sun. Here, in these stray words, were harmonic colours that must be made to
                  live on my canvas, to burn and radiate in varying degrees of intensity in the
                  hearts of my characters.</p>
               <p>I had still no plan, but now I had a definite mood within myself:
                  an emotional disquiet, that I had long since come to recognize as the forerunner
                  of almost photographic invention; when, in my mind’s eye, I would see and hear and
                  feel imagined or remembered scenes with extraordinary intensity. I began to draft
                  leaders in verse for my chapter headings, trying to make each one carry forward my
                  basic theme. That done, I mapped out the actual experiences I wished to
                  incorporate in the story; and then, as I had known I must, I spent a sleepless
                  night, struggling with the flood of images that crowded into my mind. In the
                  morning, when my housework was done, I began the story.</p>
               <p>Now all should have been simple. I had two weeks each month when
                  there were only myself and my son to care for; but I was really ill. There were
                  days on end when I sat at the machine with a mustard plaster on my head, because
                  it was less disturbing to suffer the burning sensation than the sickening throb in
                  my temples and at the base of my skull. I knew I should go to a doctor, but I
                  wanted to finish the book. I had hardly any sleep, ate scarcely anything, and
                  doped myself with aspirin. On the few occasions I went out I had to brace myself
                  like a dope addict.</p>
               <p>I went on with the book. When several chapters were completed,
                  George suggested that I should ask Mrs. McClung what she thought of them. I should
                  never have had the courage to do such a thing, and, I am glad to say, it is the
                  only time I have ever inflicted such punishment upon anybody.</p>
               <p>Mrs. McClung was kindness itself, and, when I had committed my
                  little crime, assured me that the story was good. I had begun my manuscript in
                  Victorian fashion, where the settlers arrive at Fisher’s Landing, en
                     route to Winnipeg. Mrs. McClung thought that a more colourful opening
                  would enhance the story—some flash back into the lives of the people in their
                  native land. I thought she was right, and think so still.</p>
               <p>But what lasting scorn I drew upon my innocent head by embroidering
                  a symbolic introduction! I did not want to disturb the story itself, and therefore
                  decided upon an opening scene that would combine an intimate glimpse of an
                  old-fashioned Icelandic homestead, and something of the disasters from which the
                  country had so often suffered through the centuries.</p>
               <p>I knew, as well as any one, the exact year of the last volcanic
                  eruption, which had, for its aftermath, the misery and hardship which drove so
                  many to emigrate. I certainly knew that the great volcanoes were inland—how should
                  I not, when my father had once lived under the shadow of Mount Hekla! But I did
                  not see that such specific detail was necessary to an introduction that was
                  obviously nothing but symbolism.</p>
               <p>However, the Icelandic people were so indignant that I should have
                  played fast and loose with their landscape, shrinking it, so to speak, until the
                  volcano came down to the sea, that the story itself had no merit. That I had
                  tried, to the best of my ability, to represent those spiritual qualities of the
                  people themselves, which must commend them to their Canadian brethren, was
                  completely discounted. I had made a fool of myself by not invoking a verbal map of
                  the country for a frontispiece!</p>
               <p>It is never pleasant to be wounded in one’s dearest affections. I
                  loved the brave past of my little country. I thrilled to the courage of a tiny
                  nation that neither poverty nor tyranny could reduce to spiritual bondage. This
                  courage and integrity of purpose, under whatsoever cloud or affliction, were the
                  qualities that I tried to represent as the payment Canada might expect from my
                  people for their place in national life. However, although I and all my works have
                  been tacitly repudiated by my own people, with but few exceptions, it has not
                  changed my own affection, which is all that matters. There are no losses, except
                  they rob the heart.</p>
               <p>Driven by a panic of fear that I should not finish the manuscript
                  because of illness, I wrote in a kind of frenzy. As each batch of my manuscript
                  was finished, I dictated it to my husband, who typed the final copy, and I
                  revised, to the best of my ability, at the reading. Not a very satisfactory
                  method, I will admit, and one I should shudder to attempt in a serious book
                  to-day. I had no better knowledge at the time, and little enough vitality to
                  wrestle with the story itself.</p>
               <p>When the manuscript was suitably prepared, I sent it to Mr.
                  Bothwell, and waited on tenterhooks for his opinion. The day that his first little
                  note came back was undoubtedly the happiest moment of my life.</p>
               <p>‘Hurrah! You have done it!’ wrote he. What that meant to me, no
                  words can convey. That an unpopular author was about to dawn upon the horizon is
                  not of much importance to any one. I shall come to a better reason for writing
                  this disconnected history. But that the feat was accomplished at all is due, not
                  alone to Mr. Bothwell’s inspiration, but to another man whom I must mention, for,
                  without his very concrete support, I should have had to give up almost at the
                  beginning.</p>
               <p>I refer to Mr. J. H. Cranston, formerly editor of the Toronto Star Weekly. When every other periodical rejected with cryptic
                  dismissal my human interest tales of the pioneers, Mr. Cranston found them
                  sufficiently meritorious to publish. It would be no exaggeration to say that these
                  short stories supported my books. Those earnings paid for the preparation of the
                  manuscripts, for my husband could not undertake such a task as a fixed pastime. He
                  had his own work, and, like myself, was engaged in his own self-improvement,
                  taking extension courses in traffic management, etc., efforts which he hoped might
                  be beneficial to his advancement.</p>
               <p>Those Star stories also made it possible for me
                  to undertake the research required for historical novels. There is nothing which I
                  can possibly say, by way of gratitude to Mr. Cranston, except that I have tried my
                  best to justify his faith and encouragement. That the Cranstons are enshrined with
                  my dear and honoured friends is not flattery, but an abiding fact. It may not be
                  the mission of Canadian editors to support native talent, but without some such
                  interest I fail to see how Canadian letters are to develop.</p>
               <p>I had the rather unique experience of having The
                     Viking Heart accepted on the merit of its first eighteen hundred words,
                  with the provision, naturally, that the rest would measure up to this promising
                  beginning. That took a load off my mind, and so the book was finished in three
                  months—a race which I have never been able to repeat.</p>
               <p>That it was possible even then can be explained after a fashion.
                  The story was in complete possession of my mind, mood, and feeling, and I wrote
                  all day long, and far into the night, for five days out of the week. Saturday I
                  had reserved for a thorough house-cleaning, marketing, ironing, mending, and so
                  on. Sunday I kept for my few friends. I had the good fortune to have a neighbour,
                  Mrs. Gertrude Acheson, a Press woman, and member of the Canadian Authors’
                  Association; and a neighbour she was, in the best sense of the word. There was
                  also, in Edmonton, a former girlhood acquaintance, Mrs. Johanneson, of whom more
                  later, whose hospitality and kindness brightened a toilsome period.</p>
               <p>When the book was done, I began to go to pieces. My husband thought
                  that we should leave the suite, which was noisy, and the building itself fronting
                  the street-car tracks, and find a quiet house with a bit of garden. We located an
                  attractive old place, and I used up my flagging energy getting settled. I was so
                  delighted with the garden, which was treed, and had lovely honeysuckle shrubs in
                  front of the porch. There was a little sun-room, with bright windows, that I
                  instantly saw full of flowers. I bought some second-hand chairs, and a table, and
                  after removing the old stain, enamelled them in dove-grey, with touches of blue. I
                  even painted an old congoleum rug in the same colour.</p>
               <p>I had a grand time, sewing cheerful cretonne curtains and little
                  table mats. My husband brought me a dear little puppy. It seemed to me that the
                  whole earth had a brighter, more beautiful aspect. It was the first real home I
                  had ever had. And I had it exactly thirty days! Then my husband came home one
                  morning with the news that he was ‘bumped’—that an older man had taken his
                  job.</p>
               <p>I had a vision of what it meant—of the endless hours wasted in
                  fixing and refurbishing the old house; of taking down the bright curtains that had
                  hung so gaily for only two weeks; of the packing, and crating and general turmoil
                  and eternal expense. For the first time in our wanderings, I sat down and
                  cried—the foolish tears of sheer physical exhaustion. I just could not see how I
                  should manage another bout of moving.</p>
               <p>When the fit was over I went downstairs to get the breakfast. Then
                  I took down the curtains, fetched a barrel from the basement, and began to pack
                  the dishes.</p>
               <p>I was not destined to follow our goods to Melville, however. I had
                  to undergo medical treatment that made it impossible to leave. How we should have
                  managed without the Johannesons, I cannot imagine. Mrs. Johanneson herself
                  insisted upon taking my son and myself into her own home.</p>
               <p>She had a young baby, and not too much room. But what of it, said
                  she. I could have the porch, and could cook my own special food, and young George
                  would be safe while I underwent my treatments. The sort of sacrifice plain people
                  make for each other without thought of reward, and which gets little enough
                  publicity in smart writings.</p>
               <p>Those many weeks, despite the daily jogs to the doctor, are a
                  pleasant memory. We drained so many pots of excellent Icelandic coffee out on the
                  little porch in the summer evenings; reviewed so many memories of old Winnipeg;
                  and I began to mend. For the first time in many years I could eat without
                  discomfort, walk up a flight of stairs without the weight of Atlas on my chest.
                  When my blood tests were satisfactory, the infection from which I suffered
                  eliminated, the doctor consented to my departure, cautioning me, however, not to
                  work round the clock.</p>
               <p>By this time George had gone to Calgary, so that I was spared one
                  hop, at any rate, and our few sticks of furniture escaped a second crating.
                  Calgary was not the happiest place in which to test a new-found strength—the
                  extreme altitude is no respecter of persons. But at last we were settled in
                  another house, the old floors dressed with linseed oil to permit a decent
                  camouflage with varnish, the windows decked out in altered curtains, the
                  furniture, which had stood in a railway warehouse, cleaned of grime. These gentle
                  employments over, I sat down to plot another story.</p>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>CHAPTER XLV</head>
            <div>
               <head>So Dreams Come True</head>
               <p>So we came at last to a strange morning, when my husband said:
                  ‘Your book is out. I think we should go down to Osborne’s and have a look at
                  it.’</p>
               <p>Strange as it may seem, I did not want to look at it. I was
                  suddenly afraid to meet this thing face to face. For this was not just a book to
                  me; it was the epitome of a terrible desire that had given me no rest; that had
                  hounded me relentlessly for twenty years.</p>
               <p>In a way, it was the ghost of the shabby little girl who had dared
                  to dream this thing so long ago. I wanted nothing so much as to rush away into
                  some dim, dark hill, where wisdom breathes in the silence, and the mind grows
                  still as the stars.</p>
               <p>But a sensible housewife, busily stoning plums, does not say such
                  things. I would go, of course, said I, but I first must finish the jam.</p>
               <p>‘Good heavens!’ cried George, who was perfectly willing to forego
                  his sleep after a night’s work. ‘Can’t the jam wait? I should think, after all
                  this fury of housework you’d want to get away from it.’</p>
               <p>True. Yet, how can I explain that the physical act of leaving the
                  house did not necessarily take me away from it? That what I really wanted was an
                  hour to myself—an hour spent on the little balcony that overlooked a sweep of
                  dun-coloured hills, and the silver crescent of the Bow River—an hour to cut myself
                  off in spirit from pots and pans and the four enclosing walls of a jealous
                  house.</p>
               <p>It was late afternoon before we started down the hill on this
                  intimate errand. I cannot say that I experienced any of that marvellous elation
                  that embryo authors are supposed to feel on such an occasion. My mind was too full
                  of jumbled memories.</p>
               <p>I was seeing a girl reading Victor Hugo in an attic bedroom, of a
                  house where she was nothing but a drudge; and that other young thing, going home
                  from the tent and awning factory, through sleet and snow, to struggle with an
                  assignment in English literature; I was hearing kind old Miss Rudd: ‘Laura,
                  whatever happens, never lose your sense of the beautiful. Never let yourself dream
                  little dreams!’ God bless her!</p>
               <p>I was remembering all the hundred things that had stood in the road
                  of this simple ambition. All the young heartache, all the humiliations, real or
                  imagined—all real enough, since they had cut so deeply. All the ugliness which I
                  had set myself to dispel by the force of a curiosity strong enough to penetrate to
                  bed-rock of some underlying good—all that was lovely, the winsome way of a furry
                  pet, the smile of old faces that had looked on life with courage, the beauty of
                  the embroidered sky; and the miracle of the ever fruitful earth. These were the
                  enduring realities that had kept my soul alive and my heart responsive to the
                  lives of others.</p>
               <p>And here we are at last! Here, before a commonplace plate-glass
                  window, where a little stack of books in sunset jackets make a colourful mound.
                  But I cannot see what this fine wrapper represents. I have to pull my hat down,
                  and hide my eyes.</p>
               <p>I will not enter—no, not for any gay persuasion! I have seen what I
                  came to see. I have seen the fulfilment of a dream.</p>
               <p>That is something, in a world that prides itself on materiality. A
                  small triumph, for so many years; but a small thing can demonstrate a great truth.
                  That I accomplished so little is beside the point.</p>
               <p>That truth may serve a bolder spirit to better purpose: what you
                  want, you can do, no matter what the odds against you! And to say just that, with
                  something more than mere words, is the whole purpose of this rambling narrative.
                  That I formed the resolution I must blame an unknown voice, speaking over the
                  radio. A man’s voice, pleading on behalf of Canadian literature.</p>
               <p>Somewhere, said he, on some bleak little homestead, there may be
                  another Frederick Grove, another Salverson, dreaming of a book to be written.
                  Something to that effect—the words have escaped me. They escaped me because of the
                  shock they produced. That there is another Grove somewhere, I earnestly hope; but
                  if ill luck has fastened such an ambition upon some little foreign girl
                  circumstanced as I was, I could weep for her. Yet it may be so. It may be that,
                  like myself, some child of immigrants longs to justify her race as something more
                  than a hewer of wood; dreams in the starlight of the lonely prairie of some fair
                  burnt offering to lay upon the altar of her New Country, out of the love of a
                  small, passionate heart.</p>
               <p>How to do it, in a strange, new language? How to do it, in the face
                  of poverty and isolation, and the cold indifference of an alien people? How to
                  hold fast to a purpose that no one counts as precious as a new-turned furrow, a
                  pelt of furs, or a load of grain.</p>
               <p>It can be done, as simply as the seasons follow the sun. It can be
                  done by the simple, undistinguished feat of snatching at straws; a word, a phrase,
                  a tantalizing speech, to be stored in the mind, analysed, thumbed over, as a miser
                  thumbs his gold; sights and sounds; the way a bird wheels in the wind; the
                  moonlight dappling deep water; the sound of withered grasses telling their
                  rosaries of frost and seeds; a thousand images to feed the mind in the sterile
                  days of drudgery. It can be done by robbing sleep to hobnob with the thinkers of
                  times present and past. It can be done by accepting pain, which, like a sharp
                  sword, cuts through the stupidities that shut us off from our neighbours.</p>
               <p>It can be done by keeping true to the thing within you, that no man
                  sees, and only the great gods cherish! For each living creature has its own,
                  inalienable covenant with the universe; its own small service to perform; every
                  creative thought is a part of that universe, and has, within itself, the essence
                  of its fulfilment. This I believe, and this I hope I shall always believe. Life to
                  all men is not the same thing, but it is the same in this: that it becomes for
                  them what they earnestly believe and relentlessly strive to make it.</p>
               <p>All things are in the eye of the beholder. A fall of leaves from a
                  scarlet maple-tree trembles for an infinitesimal point of time on the air,
                  vibrates rhythmically, giving off ruby tints of light, and, in its drifting
                  flight, arrests the eye of a chance observer.</p>
               <p>Something in him responds. Beautiful! Beautiful! His senses leap,
                  as to the sound of bugles. His imagination soars as on wings; and a thousand frets
                  of life are instantly forgotten.</p>
               <p>To another, the lovely miracle does not exist. Dead leaves have
                  blown across his path. The shining incarnation has passed unseen, unheard. The
                  little rustling of the ruby leaves taking their joyous departure, has passed the
                  way of all spirit. No god was crucified on the flaming tree for the redemption of
                  his earth-bound senses. There was nothing in the wood; nothing in the winding
                  road; nothing in the pale, evening air.</p>
               <p>It is so with everything in the world: out of the
                     heart are the issues of life!</p>
